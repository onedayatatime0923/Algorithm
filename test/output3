PREFACE 36700
My 42073
aim 49636
in 49684
this 49796
book 66103
has 68982
been 69311
to 70689
reproduce 90270
my 93542
own 125244
experience 139437
in 144264
our 166610
Civil 167042
War 167693
in 173075
such 176391
a 181532
way 17306
as 18803
to 18820
help 20301
the 20490
reader 21020
understand 24383
just 33109
how 49671
the 49728
duties 71848
and 75545
the 76525
problems 92725
of 93356
that 93852
great 99812
conflict 99898
presented 125302
themselves 134815
successively 136081
to 136978
one 166741
man 167245
who 167601
had 171111
an 171217
active 176827
part 177774
in 177828
it 180120
from 181533
the 181584
beginning 18804
to 18821
the 20681
end 21059
In 32667
my 42075
military 72015
service 75562
I 76792
was 76986
so 87372
conscious 93728
of 93940
the 94320
benefit 99881
it 99937
was 127622
to 129718
me 142592
to 163971
get 167296
the 167511
personal 167649
view 167871
of 176529
men 177732
who 177776
had 180122
served 181534
in 17313
our 18805
own 18822
or 33251
other 38082
wars 72017
as 72177
distinguished 73575
from 77004
the 99600
general 100221
or 101454
formal 102600
history 118929
that 127770
I 128466
formed 128516
the 130228
purpose 136137
soon 136600
after 157897
peace 158789
was 177910
restored 181535
to 2164
write 118853
such 3173
a 18806
narrative 24698
of 39725
my 72361
own 101934
army 102220
life 102935
My 103527
relations 104174
to 104327
many 118021
prominent 128802
officers 130168
and 130246
civilians 130272
were 143021
such 153885
as 154028
to 161141
give 167696
opportunities 167907
for 175908
intimate 176738
knowledge 177836
of 181536
their 181587
personal 181663
qualities 17325
as 18807
well 23403
as 25307
their 25361
public 33502
conduct 72246
It 76980
has 98595
seemed 101410
to 103652
me 104313
that 104935
it 108831
might 111515
be 117531
useful 177351
to 177762
share 177803
with 178102
others 181557
what 181590
I 1350
thus 56729
learned 164
and 2512
to 140428
throw 2436
what 140352
light 18808
I 23421
could 73460
upon 117405
the 118438
events 118578
and 126828
the 136851
men 158813
of 159228
that 164799
time 168006
As 171541
I 178688
have 181591
written 17340
historical 18809
accounts 33544
of 34928
some 50567
campaigns 55426
separately 74710
it 111164
may 117303
be 133351
proper 154105
to 178118
say 178696
that 181321
I 181617
have 16785
in 18216
this 18825
book 42004
avoided 44721
repetition 47392
and 47840
have 49154
tried 50615
to 67981
make 69395
the 71236
personal 80899
narrative 81713
supplement 83101
and 86723
lend 87813
new 122511
interest 127477
to 133441
the 136369
more 138888
formal 144603
story 158959
Some 162473

Though 40923
my 68660
private 69312
memoranda 74728
are 85013
full 137327
enough 157693
to 16603
give 26060

reasonable 41068

the 173980
ordinary 174182
routine 174555

but 176870
with 176892
a 178004
sense 178174
of 179416
anxiety 179756
and 179985
strain 180320
which 180436
was 180486
caused 180594
by 180823

troubled 2680

hope 53723
that 121584
some 155973
peaceful 185045
way 163610
out 30756
of 173223
our 173262
troubles 116453
would 97443
be 116215
found 116394
yet 105634
the 121810
gathering 180235

army 46215
on 142307
the 1934
sands 80063
opposite 80141
Fort 80338
Sumter 83195
was 100777
really 101228
war 103753
and 104099
if 104222
a 104887
hostile 105062
gun 105551
were 105649
fired 105683
we 107319
knew 107575
it 107976
would 108229
mean 108555
the 108599
end 109092
of 109202
all 110560
effort 111875
at 112480
arrangement 122586

almost 104796
against 1917
hope 104870
that 3810
blood 5838
would 6667
not 7055
be 9997
shed 10077
and 12212
that 12376
the 13359
pageant 14373

military 17196
array 22308
and 22640
of 38507
a 38670
rebel 39230

would 60588
pass 67840
by 70053
and 119299
soon 133235
be 133381
reckoned 133436
among 134205
the 134244
disused 134415
scenes 134830
and 136319
properties 139093
of 140557
a 140572
political 148360
drama 148988
that 150425
never 151404
pretended 151673
to 152549
be 153517
more 157658
than 158232
acting 158446
we 158545
tried 159113
to 163470
give 163779
our 166524
thoughts 166569
to 166675
business 166942
but 166995
there 167274
was 167347
no 167505
heart 167544
in 167596
it 167868
and 168536
the 168666
morning 168730
hour 169757
lagged 169780
for 171143
we 171236
could 171270
not 171293
work 171345
in 171722
earnest 172224
and 172458
we 173072
were 176386
unwilling 179125
to 179226
adjourn 179260
Suddenly 2651
a 147700
senator 3004
came 163399
in 155820
from 156280
the 156445
lobby 156641
in 2818
an 152852
excited 153935
way 156148
and 157168
catching 160565
the 147370
chairman's 46136
eye 641
exclaimed 101931
Mr 118222
President 185007
the 9
telegraph 67
announces 180
that 400
the 5031
secessionists 6647
are 17373
bombarding 58439
Fort 59876
Sumter 60034
There 61559
was 64263
a 64647
solemn 112588
and 118716
painful 175472
hush 182518
but 95566
it 21709
was 37272
broken 37943
in 133900
a 133923
moment 134331
by 135619
a 135653
woman's 135752
shrill 135919
voice 136112
from 137535
the 137605
spectators' 153607
seats 63674
crying 74111
Glory 143666
to 145419
God 2713
It 152747
startled 152860
every 167500
one 167784
almost 159898
as 12111
if 14424
the 181308
enemy 167065
were 158365
in 164035
the 164240
midst 164247
But 179114
it 110653
was 110733
the 111272
voice 142527
of 142620
a 142726
radical 2484
friend 140400
of 55321
the 99462
slave 162296
who 120628
after 120640
a 120910
lifetime 121168
of 121872
public 121946
agitation 2162
believed 118851
that 81826
only 82920
through 41463
blood 48881
could 77593
freedom 79112
be 79137
won 95548
Abby 115682
Kelly 12020
Foster 38669
had 64074
been 23126
attending 1746
the 2124
session 2665
of 2979
the 12014
Assembly 14987
urging 16584
the 16638
passage 16804
of 16853
some 16919
measures 17033
enlarging 17070
the 17666
legal 18947
rights 19122
of 20524
married 22353
women 25415
and 25642
sitting 25652
beyond 30099
the 31072
railing 31818
when 33091
the 33097
news 35068
came 35399
in 37624
shouted 37640
a 38369
fierce 38602
cry 43884
of 45458
joy 45966
that 48647
oppression 51103
had 51202
submitted 53821
its 54671
cause 55156
to 56207
the 62116
decision 64063
of 67141
the 69581
sword 69608
With 69622
most 69690
of 69731
us 69761
the 69837
gloomy 69935
thought 70088
that 70506
civil 70619
war 71220
had 71521
begun 71750
in 72362
our 72395
own 72476
land 74313
overshadowed 74360
everything 74416
and 74511
seemed 76618
too 76664
great 76681
a 76750
price 77097
to 77558
pay 77564
for 77596
any 77599
good 77662
a 77845
scourge 77938
to 77998
be 78103
borne 78111
only 78282
in 78634
preference 78682
to 78690
yielding 78870
the 78987
very 81825
groundwork 82919
of 88635
our 90556
republicanism 90629
--the 90794
right 90914
to 91830
enforce 92511
a 93998
fair 94039
interpretation 94138
of 94448
the 95175
Constitution 95202
through 95458
the 95506
election 95775
of 95854
President 110933
and 112299
Congress 114871
The 115286
next 115294
day 115668
we 116874
learned 118813
that 118994
Major 119227
Anderson 119305
had 119541
surrendered 121845
and 129489

from 131587
all 132133
the 133962
Northern 133981
States 135488
showed 136116
plain 137356
evidence 137383
of 138710
a 139410
popular 145605
outburst 145831
of 145908
loyalty 145978
to 147714
the 149093
Union 149241

the 748

Tuesday 126825
in 71409
order 71422
as 74335
he 74382

opportunity 55891
to 56227

the 59644
perilous 64226
crisis 64344
of 110222

No 144369

was 31725
made 31750
to 142524
the 2489

and 23065
the 138482

took 423
a 18733
similar 120600
recess 16323
All 64365
were 120005
in 85443
a 174166
state 185147
of 89880
most 2833
anxious 157504
suspense 19440
--the 59530
Republicans 59646
to 64229
know 64346
what 110225
initiative 128013
the 4679
Administration 8902
at 17300
Washington 17437
would 17688
take 53566
and 58928
the 86686
Democrats 119918
to 124337
determine 160292
what 175529
course 875
they 16235
should 489
follow 2073
if 2759
the 2960
President 3150
should 3421
call 16914
for 17155
troops 17429
to 17487

of 67146
the 68936
North 70388
forgetting 70975
all 71214
party 74613
distinctions 74703
answered 75240
with 75831
an 76208
enthusiastic 83120
patriotism 84388
that 85314
swept 85435
politicians 88147
off 89572
their 89608

the 112049
people 112653
have 113929
gone 113987
stark 114095
mad 114248
I 114555
knew 116347
they 116700
would 117298
if 117584
a 118083
blow 118705

the 141826
politicians 141893
of 148291
the 151438
day 151981
partly 152061
by 152793
sympathy 154166
with 155834
the 157669
overwhelming 159980
current 160448
of 160666
public 163355
opinion 164156
and 164397
partly 164469
by 165156
reaction 166005
of 166716
their 168170
own 168759

which 175794
had 175818
encouraged 175885
the 181510

to 17782
support 18063
the 19145
war 19823

the 25032

opposition 52958
to 67773
such 68614

be 79962

The 104984
attitude 105668
of 106222
Mr 106319
Key 106374
is 107565
only 107861
a 108602

of 139626
the 141305
most 146456
striking 154326
features 159219
of 160696
the 161954
time 162089
On 162139
the 162264
8th 162311
of 164060
January 165804
the 168450
usual 169702
Democratic 173931
convention 176180

of 178397
the 178904
Battle 178982
of 181463
New 38901
Orleans 1925
had 104878
taken 88395
place 162000
and 3767
a 5434
series 17430
of 53340
resolutions 54764
had 54838
been 58532
passed 78849
which 137141
were 142761
drafted 142820
as 142868
was 143414
understood 143428
by 143800
Judge 143905
Thurman 144208
In 144732
these 145381
professing 145619

speak 152867
in 153617
the 155995
name 156159
of 156582
two 157100
hundred 158241
thousand 28411
Democrats 142799
of 142856
Ohio 143505
the 35857
convention 35896
had 36002
very 142310
significantly 114867
intimated 115673
that 64398
this 173025
vast 181199
organization 130349
of 75354
men 142398
would 3760
be 121487
found 153744
in 156070
the 156088
way 64426
of 146529
any 184165
attempt 64604
to 164007
put 184950
down 16312
secession 17328
until 17391
the 53352
demands 97349
of 97440
the 90168
South 183259
in 66719
respect 85709
to 85760
slavery 86326
were 147545
complied 161455
with 36006
A 160
few 1807
days 1954
afterward 1983
I 3075
was 3156
returning 3219
to 5965
Columbus 39443
from 77372
my 88388
home 88438
in 89224
Trumbull 89926
County 90136
and 91063
meeting 94371
upon 94950
the 96356
railway 97989
train 98423
with 98458
David 98761
Tod 98884
then 99399
an 99539
active 99575
Democratic 100181
politician 100315
but 101011
afterward 102361
one 102661
of 103176
our 103290
loyal 103336
war 104462
governors 104907
the 106761
conversation 107005
turned 107073
on 107470
the 107793
action 108347
of 108380
the 108460
convention 108711
which 108850
had 109263
just 109445
adjourned 109533
Mr 110111
Tod 110147
and 110190
I 110263
were 111169
personal 111322
friends 111346
and 111486
neighbors 112737
and 112986
I 117111
freely 117196
expressed 117277
my 117448
surprise 117485
that 117505
the 117629
convention 117719
should 125920
have 126652
committed 127303
itself 128548
to 128826
what 128941
must 130530
be 131147
interpreted 133685
as 133785
a 133918
threat 150281
of 153590
insurrection 156331
in 157635
the 158194
North 158568
if 158638
the 158692
administration 159043
should 159188
in 162839
opposing 163069
secession 163640
by 163739
force 164927
follow 166136
the 166780
example 169011
of 169271
Andrew 169581
Jackson 170102
in 170198
whose 171061
honor 171254
they 171439
had 171765
assembled 172481
He 172577
rather 172848
vehemently 173067
reasserted 173590
the 175891
substance 175954
of 176381
the 176666
resolution 176769
saying 176963
that 177173
we 177307
Republicans 177424
would 179054
find 179231
the 179239
two 179298
hundred 179488
thousand 180132
Ohio 180169
Democrats 181052
in 181070
front 181245
of 182465
us 1708
if 88597
we 3096
attempted 169602
to 2741
cross 152775
the 974
Ohio 21809
River 23989
My 1132
answer 1196
was 30131
We 30147
will 30228
give 31182
up 37086
the 44708
contest 44945
if 45143
we 45292
cannot 45393
carry 46710
your 47043
two 47557
hundred 47844
thousand 48338
over 48447
the 48627
heads 48681
of 49135
your 49368
leaders 49393
The 49408
result 49573
proved 131864
how 78474
hollow 118061
the 118128
party 78454
professions 104373
had 118026
been 118098
or 108698
perhaps 118441
I 167576
should 123821
say 159847
how 92950
superficial 2820
was 4226
the 55349
hold 55357
of 55409
such 68838
party 71098
doctrines 74468
upon 74606
the 76402
mass 138451
of 152854
men 152871
in 155476
a 155502
great 155629
political 157104
organization 167501
In 167785
the 168524
excitement 168610
of 2792
political 152826
campaigns 2787
they 152821
had 57580
cheered 1051
the 2743
extravagant 2801
language 8485
of 23136
party 29126
platforms 36517
with 46126
very 55561
little 80127
reflection 87408
and 152777
the 152835
leaders 153936
had 155674
imagined 155789
that 156149
the 156507
people 156548
were 157094
really 157169
and 51315
earnestly 76019
indoctrinated 76129
into 66152
the 15
political 73
creed 552
of 4002
Calhoun 28131
but 55813
at 91273
the 99178
first 99221
shot 142321
from 143810
Beauregard's 181527
guns 181547
in 181566
Charleston 181607
harbor 182506
their 182524
latent 85042
patriotism 99210
sprang 173164
into 1776
vigorous 88665
life 99449
and 118007
they 108078
crowded 135490
to 139411
the 135583
recruiting 107186
stations 108273
to 108317
enlist 109796
for 109803
the 109931
defence 110318
of 110339
the 110346
national 107152
flag 107266
and 107697
the 107836
national 107991
Union 108141
It 108330
was 108359
a 110080
popular 182602
torrent 19117
which 19805
no 20069
leaders 20468
could 22095
resist 25114
but 25397
many 25481
of 26747
these 26834
should 33601
be 33749
credited 33877
with 34014
the 34198
same 35464
patriotic 45655
impulse 46638
and 46966
it 47450
made 47623
them 47752
nobly 47803
oblivious 48331
of 48524
party 49654
consistency 49793
Stephen 49956
A 49989
Douglas 71252
passed 71444
through 72223
Columbus 85999
on 93050
his 93140
way 94442
to 125476
Washington 132058
a 136603
few 137370
days 137829
after 137867
the 138764
surrender 163998
of 164131
Sumter 164199
and 173314
in 950
response 21785
to 1987
the 111350
calls 959
of 21794
a 173231
spontaneous 34169
gathering 34431
of 34591
people 1042
spoke 29117
to 1392
them 5999
from 56771
his 64712
bedroom 159886
window 173865
in 46122
the 173437
American 174014
House 2371
There 51204
had 69610
been 69732
no 70089
thought 70414
for 70434
any 74463
of 74512
the 74659
common 74739
surroundings 74748
of 76644
a 77559
public 89430
meeting 91428
There 92513
were 93999
no 94009
torches 94139
no 94192
music 94597
A 95540
dark 102511
crowd 114836
of 114861
men 114892
filled 114967
full 115322
the 116977
dim-lit 131055
street 133963
and 134128
called 134299
for 135567
Douglas 136082
with 136141
an 136937
earnestness 137537
of 137618
tone 138486
wholly 139370
different 139394
from 142430
the 181696
enthusiasm 181821
of 182046
common 69903
political 73667
gatherings 74314
He 74417
came 74723
half-dressed 94556
to 94755
his 94864
window 95231
and 102507
without 114786
any 114806
light 115036
near 115457
him 115843
spoke 116232
solemnly 95806
to 96026
the 96096
people 1021
upon 1034
the 1084
terrible 29096
crisis 29109
which 29277
had 33121
come 33256
upon 33745
the 33808
nation 34018
Men 34065
of 34610
all 34704
parties 36595
were 36642
there 37038
his 37260
own 37350
followers 37443
to 38112
get 38295
some 39559
light 51192
as 51208
to 181636
their 79698
duty 80172
the 88882
Breckinridge 164126
Democrats 2349
ready 3107
most 3223
of 46143
them 68411
repentantly 70345
to 131033
follow 133211
a 133524
Northern 150168
leader 150185
now 157882
that 158271
their 161495
recent 161970
candidate 162401
was 162862
in 163148
the 163227
rebellion 163983
Footnote 164260
Breckinridge 164499
did 164865
not 169613
formally 170379
join 171016
the 171653
Confederacy 171868
till 171967
September 172103
but 172142
his 172468
accord 173255
with 173507
the 173672
secessionists 173857
was 174411
well 174439
known 174607
the 175958
Republicans 176015
eagerly 176157
anxious 176907
to 176998
know 177482
whether 179083
so 179304
potent 179381
an 179929
influence 180137
was 180314
to 181040
be 143003
unreservedly 143096
on 143102
the 143106
side 143158
of 143235
the 1335
country 56714
I 101576
remember 154
well 539
the 85350
serious 86643
solicitude 93427
with 93474
which 96325
I 97676
listened 99731
to 99755
his 99853
opening 101474
sentences 101498
as 103734
I 103962
leaned 103993
against 104183
the 107343
railing 108587
of 110626
the 112297
State 113995
House 114515
park 172877
trying 181526
in 181546
vain 181990
to 182505
get 183239
more 184384
than 184269
a 184373
dim 126383
outline 126691
of 127065
the 181732
man 182092
as 2832
he 157503
stood 786
at 9844
the 2603
unlighted 147652
window 151744
His 182082
deep 1404
sonorous 65710
voice 184367
rolled 184267
down 182773
through 184355
the 149
darkness 185189
from 163083
above 174927
us 180661
--an 180682
earnest 168288
measured 157689
voice 157762
the 158221
more 158499
solemn 54874
the 56224
more 75
impressive 18841
because 123749
we 4234
could 17572
not 17700
see 26247
the 43885
speaker 84996
and 155923
it 156225
came 156373
to 156509
us 156616
literally 159879
as 2812
a 152846
voice 104027
in 105004
the 105960
night 106082
--the 108802
night 72981
of 152878
our 153423
country's 166885
unspeakable 14475
trial 15258
There 25653
was 25797
no 45459
uncertainty 45669
in 48648
his 48722
tone 48738
the 48853
Union 48955
must 62110
be 62137
preserved 137359
and 137384
the 173684
insurrection 173725
must 138095
be 138463
crushed 173825
--he 41296
pledged 165438
his 17695
hearty 118703
support 125591
to 143415
Mr 50617
Lincoln's 54912
administration 54934
in 140513
doing 143020
this 145137
Other 161811
questions 162717
must 164845
stand 160390
aside 184746
till 184220
the 141730
national 120644
authority 3822
should 4129
be 4239
everywhere 12276
recognized 153614
I 3911
do 4171
not 4338
think 4652
we 142859
greatly 143081
cheered 164073
him 5531
--it 5798
was 6657
rather 6898
a 7209
deep 9920
Amen 12224
that 15506
went 16358
up 16389
from 16500
the 16702
crowd 17410
We 22492
went 22806
home 27209
breathing 27706
freer 30773
in 38374
the 38934
assurance 77803
we 119413
now 119622
felt 145065
that 166938
for 167370
a 772
time 2132
at 3347
least 31821
no 118821
organized 759
opposition 3334
to 750
the 3325
federal 138
government 1427
and 9369
its 18775
policy 22288
of 22939
coercion 40040
would 50248
be 65733
formidable 66619
in 66748
the 67884
North 68421
We 68803
did 69041
not 69109
look 70717
for 75402
unanimity 75423
Bitter 78102
and 78329
narrow 87042
men 87866
there 88433
were 118525
whose 121422
sympathies 126835
were 131310
with 132919
their 133288
country's 133366
enemies 133770
Others 136725
equally 140811
narrow 141666
were 143703
still 148227
in 148402
the 148415
chains 148466
of 148835
the 153565
secession 154635
logic 157726
they 158105
had 158406
learned 158604
from 159636
the 170319
Calhounists 170450
but 170831
the 172088
broader-minded 172312
men 176626
found 178307
themselves 179440
happy 182587
in 2341
being 131025
free 1432
from 65738
disloyal 1225
theories 50455
and 1503
threw 73795
themselves 2934
sincerely 163329
and 50510
earnestly 26528
into 2607
the 147656
popular 184202
movement 89309
There 69508
was 9515
no 90557
more 67824
doubt 119297
where 119334
Douglas 91784
or 139
Tod 182588
or 185048
Key 121621
would 30663
be 28853
found 28879
or 33412
any 33458
of 33792
the 33956
great 36263
class 159438
they 26967
represented 27141
Yet 28804
the 41348
situation 181485
hung 181519
upon 181542
us 181560
like 181604
a 13859
nightmare 122
Garfield 182571
and 50659
I 53894
were 55103
lodging 55254
together 55508
at 144750
the 148881
time 152451
our 154003
wives 157093
being 157392
kept 157797
at 163697
home 1437
by 65743
family 181706
cares 182115
and 182159
when 182313
we 182380
reached 1750
our 88639
sitting-room 183614
after 183648
an 183816
evening 143794
session 53771
of 1252
the 50482
Senate 85494
we 33668
often 14
found 72
ourselves 182523
involuntarily 185379
groaning 152662
Civil 185055
war 185286
in 85702
our 124298
land 161451
The 162285
shame 162314
the 1853
outrage 103908
the 104806
folly 105483
seemed 105641
too 105704
great 105746
to 103893
believe 104940
and 105340
we 105421
half 105627
hoped 106592
to 107133
wake 107351
from 4517
it 4591
as 4969
from 734
a 3309
dream 30990
Among 32302
the 39222
painful 39248
remembrances 184983
of 185041
those 18849
days 97674
is 97733
the 23109
ever-present 101334
weight 129145
at 129148
the 129180
heart 50509
which 30740
never 997
left 29072
me 165538
till 168676
I 16855
found 16906
relief 78938
in 79015
the 79033
active 1842
duties 1916
of 1933
camp 100776
life 101227
at 103752
the 104098
close 104221
of 104795
the 104869
month 104886
I 105061
went 105550
about 105648
my 105682
duties 107318
and 107574
I 107975
am 108228
sure 108554
most 108598
of 109091
those 109201
I 110559
associated 111874
with 112479
did 122585
the 94999
same 97958
with 111802
the 6701
half-choking 17495
sense 20860
of 25636
a 34556
grief 39301
I 42483
dared 47387
not 47532
think 72013
of 80663
like 88837
one 101932
who 104270
is 127758
dragging 139801
himself 141343
to 156228
the 169639
ordinary 181983
labors 105631
of 15035
life 12949
from 60913
some 1025
terrible 16854
and 29100
recent 32520
bereavement 33092
We 38603
talked 47091
of 72042
our 79415
personal 88763
duty 92146
and 124277
though 127295
both 153692
Garfield 158826
and 164988
myself 165039
had 182968
young 183068
families 183331
we 183341
were 183442
agreed 183522
that 183524
our 183544
activity 183546
in 183547
the 183573
organization 183575
and 183613
support 183647
of 183675
the 183691
Republican 183814
party 183815
made 183839
the 183841
duty 183842
of 184112
supporting 3061
the 3137
government 169567
by 175872
military 105
service 182530
come 3
peculiarly 77
home 182512
to 184933
us 182525
He 184374
was 184339
for 184556
the 11382
moment 16897
somewhat 48101
trammelled 51378
by 67308
his 115568
half-clerical 145726
position 172887
but 176570
he 43471
very 80798
soon 105532
cut 107640
the 108202
knot 108658
My 109309
own 109319
path 109356
seemed 109538
unmistakably 140511
clear 105403
He 107825
more 108648
careful 109293
for 1205
his 1877
friend 1904
than 1920
for 2844
himself 2919
urged 2954
upon 3103
me 3205
his 7923
doubts 34634
whether 39448
my 44717
physical 50080
strength 50401
was 50515
equal 65824
to 67765
the 68067
strain 71830
that 71994
would 72077
be 72186
put 72414
upon 74281
it 76537
I 83841
said 103747
he 104202
am 104830
big 104857
and 104873
strong 105144
and 105214
if 105470
my 105652
relations 106476
to 106655
the 107164
church 107216
and 107322
the 107710
college 107737
can 107970
be 108160
broken 108327
I 108362
shall 108558
have 109188
no 109715
excuse 109788
for 109810
not 109940
enlisting 110571
but 110688
you 110772
are 111219
slender 111279
and 111878
will 111934
break 112483
down 112683
It 122562
was 134707
true 137082
that 137138
I 137595
looked 149929
slender 149992
for 150065
a 150116
man 150450
six 150805
feet 157515
high 157590
though 157681
it 157953
would 157976
hardly 158141
be 158351
suspected 158378
now 158985
that 162853
it 163075
was 163302
so 163349
yet 163825
I 163866
had 163909
assured 164038
confidence 164222
in 164234
the 164413
elasticity 166169
of 168964
my 169609
constitution 170110
and 171128
the 171163
result 171604
justified 172988
me 173009
whilst 173346
it 173432
also 173571
showed 174005
how 174211
liable 174894
to 175015
mistake 175327
one 175388
is 175468
in 175706
such 175940
things 176313
Garfield 176432
found 176839
that 176971
he 178058
had 178318
a 178646
tendency 179250
to 179773
weakness 180027
of 180071
the 180116
alimentary 180177
system 180293
which 180359
broke 180578
him 180967
down 182371
on 1509
every 73801
campaign 71103
in 10338
which 27956
he 62163
served 83674
and 124497
led 148107
to 148465
his 136782
retiring 136796
from 136877
the 137882
army 138371
much 132319
earlier 132435
than 63894
he 68695
had 160443
intended 160500
My 160690
own 174213
health 163002
on 12342
the 14733
other 71007
hand 80306
was 80312
strengthened 141226
by 135405
out-door 140244
life 168841
and 9923
exposure 12344
and 14739
I 15640
served 21954
to 22561
the 22816
end 25657
with 26455
growing 30763
physical 33038
vigor 33520
When 35475
Mr 36386
Lincoln 36718
issued 48017
his 48657
first 48806
call 48877
for 69713
troops 76647
the 76687
existing 77590
laws 77623
made 78114
it 79115
necessary 88437
that 91619
these 91933
should 95544
be 95703
fully 96149
organized 114866
and 115672
officered 115685
by 142346
the 23479
several 26401
States 34292
Then 51778
the 132415
treasury 132470
was 132504
in 132555
no 138213
condition 138393
to 170426
bear 29780
the 37177
burden 42065
of 132134
war 132179
expenditures 132367
and 61889
till 14456
Congress 14493
could 185013
assemble 120195
the 120603
President 122058
was 152358
forced 164019
to 164025
rely 173293
on 173429
the 62466
States 64087
to 182507
furnish 181129
the 5964
means 179487
necessary 20319
for 31786
the 31910
equipment 38623
and 89151
transportation 93279
of 1006
their 29081
own 38708
troops 61608
This 64750
threw 95
upon 12999
the 60847
governors 61191
and 61618
legislatures 63164
of 64061
the 147912
loyal 149039
States 35307
responsibilities 48689
of 48927
a 35339
kind 48988
wholly 143095
unprecedented 153625
A 30920
long 55100
period 55505
of 64605
profound 62458
peace 64250
had 64652
made 161431
every 64773
military 99736
organization 101504
seem 53955
almost 58010
farcical 62575
A 67597
few 79486
independent 85076
military 147042
companies 152497
formed 180170
the 41939
merest 55941
shadow 99302
of 138577
an 176678
army 85820
the 173913
state 68674
militia 69015
proper 99792
was 104142
only 105818
a 107650
nominal 108526
thing 176320
It 176945
happened 177599
however 77565
that 95204
I 95296
held 95310
a 156022
commission 156028
as 141239
Brigadier 117844
in 165624
this 184270
state 184528
militia 57211
and 121585
my 143793
intimacy 185046
with 28403
Governor 42598
Dennison 149474
led 1254
him 6664
to 16586
call 50484
upon 53823
me 54039
for 55098
such 55503
assistance 64065
as 72041
I 115296
could 122045
render 137358
in 143675
the 144849
first 153999
enrolment 165393
and 172837
organization 173683
of 184061
the 184174
Ohio 184175
quota 184264
Arranging 184281
to 184385
be 184527
called 184541
to 184572
the 184647
Senate 184344
chamber 2597
when 147646
my 1074
vote 37028
might 1832
be 1978
needed 104785
upon 111341
important 184568
legislation 184328
I 184365
gave 184569
my 127061
time 184349
chiefly 181727
to 182761
such 182764
military 184985
matters 116924
as 98103
the 111586
governor 116255
appointed 79700
Although 80126
as 82610
I 83062
have 141512
said 23071
my 30265
military 30439
commission 42297
had 47449
been 47742
a 67193
nominal 77434
thing 80062
and 80140
in 80337
fact 83194
I 131950
had 132073
never 86007
worn 127305
a 151266
uniform 62382
I 64072
had 100785
not 39292
wholly 92947
neglected 141511
theoretic 2316
preparation 30221
for 30316
such 30443
work 32336
For 32583
some 35392
years 35457
the 35567
possibility 43915
of 43951
a 44007
war 44098
of 47457
secession 47683
had 48590
been 48712
one 48993
of 49123
the 49287
things 49351
which 49415
would 49580
force 49679
itself 49765
upon 49965
the 51116
thoughts 65851
of 68304
reflecting 69559
people 69768
and 69828
I 131000
had 131542
been 131744
led 131770
to 132789
give 139380
some 75508
careful 76549
study 76893
to 138746
such 118694
books 89
of 28421
tactics 55428
and 65813
of 67983
strategy 103039
as 144266
were 144476
within 160659
easy 162099
reach 121505
I 167323
had 98058
especially 115052
been 115226
led 29281
to 31773
read 33137
military 33353
history 33701
with 33864
critical 34740
care 36603
and 36661
had 36812
carried 36922
away 37246
many 37455
valuable 37761
ideas 38065
from 40884
this 41234
most 41284
useful 41385
means 43958
of 44051
military 44109
education 45075
I 47654
had 47667
therefore 47722
some 47770
notion 48379
of 48583
the 49114
work 49481
before 49716
us 49887
and 50951
could 51111
approach 74026
its 74322
problems 93387
with 93536
less 93597
loss 93793
of 93899
time 99808
at 99835
least 100058
than 101250
if 101526
I 102812
had 104164
been 104324
wholly 104366
ignorant 116751
Footnote 116778
I 118041
have 118241
treated 123119
this 125413
subject 132101
somewhat 134275
more 168604
fully 2078
in 111441
a 1090
paper 37044
in 1743

in 21979
the 22390

it 88456
had 88475
been 88491
understood 88500
for 97988
several 98457
days 98760

about 136216
the 142288
same 57548
time 84147
Captain 100893
George 120549
B 126210
McClellan 128213
was 144822
requested 118700
by 154005
Governor 164130
Dennison 1482
to 29398
come 65788
to 68310
Columbus 69772
for 69872
consultation 69913
and 70644
by 70874
the 70938
governor's 71025
request 71080
I 71124
met 71264
him 71695
at 71844
the 72712
railway 73481
station 73856
and 74085
took 74653
him 74821
to 76992
the 131535
State 69990
House 1144
I 31180
think 32540
Mr 32611
Larz 32695
Anderson 33477
brother 33478
of 33660
Major 33854
Robert 33880
Anderson 34111
and 34760
Mr 34797
L'Hommedieu 34844
of 35609
Cincinnati 35647
were 36647
with 36784
him 37401
The 37427
intimation 37693
had 38139
been 39809
given 39838
me 39884
that 39998
he 41159
would 41259
probably 42364
be 43789
made 43887
major-general 44090
and 44174
commandant 44656
of 47542
our 47593
Ohio 47872
contingent 48288
and 48332
this 49491
naturally 49503
made 49746
me 49781
scan 49909
him 49976
closely 54721
He 56511
was 131519
rather 28803
under 32711
the 33545
medium 34724
height 35065
but 35680
muscularly 36708
formed 37255
with 37364
broad 37574
shoulders 37836
and 37891
a 39924
well-poised 39927
head 47756
active 47841
and 48533
graceful 49270
in 49672
motion 50365
His 50499
whole 54049
appearance 1046
was 29121
quiet 1087
and 37041
modest 1185
but 44697
when 113743
drawn 171950
out 827
he 9885
showed 3827
no 4672
lack 5722
of 6622
confidence 11759
in 12520
himself 15924
He 16488
was 16564
dressed 16632
in 16662
a 16758
plain 16835
travelling 16933
suit 17069
with 17219
a 17365
narrow-rimmed 17489
soft 17587
felt 17677
hat 17745
In 18145
short 18255
he 18293
seemed 18504
what 18630
he 18656
was 18750
a 18982
railway 19046
superintendent 19100
in 19184
his 19434
business 19847
clothes 19915
At 20450
the 20851
time 21028
his 21127
name 22157
was 22852
a 22933
good 23235
deal 23351
associated 23396
with 24718
that 24963
of 25297
Beauregard 26480
they 26613
were 26782
spoken 26966
of 27140
as 28344
young 28802
men 28852
of 28878
similar 31403
standing 31621
in 31902
the 32664
Engineer 33174
Corps 33326
of 33411
the 33457
Army 33530
and 33702
great 33791
things 33821
were 33955
expected 34033
of 34147
them 34306
both 34389
because 34808
of 34931
their 35013
scientific 35043
knowledge 35156
of 35365
their 35548
profession 35687
though 36262
McClellan 36518
had 36690
been 36746
in 36847
civil 37129
life 37358
for 37529
some 37687
years 37826
His 38288
report 39211
on 39415
the 39742
Crimean 39852
War 40004
was 40120
one 40758
of 40870
the 40950
few 41346
important 42078
memoirs 43738
our 43862
old 43918
army 43998
had 44114
produced 45514
and 46120
was 47723
valuable 48024
enough 48571
to 49370
give 49468
a 49637
just 49701
reputation 49847
for 50552
comprehensive 50574
understanding 50624
of 50670
military 50836
organization 50878
and 51491
the 54870
promise 54926
of 56461
ability 57103
to 59641
conduct 59740
the 59801
operations 60523
of 61539
an 61815
army 62136
I 63708
was 63877
present 63997
at 64266
the 65008
interview 65881
which 66023
the 66117
governor 66589
had 66979
with 67148
him 67456
The 67745
destitution 67948
of 67984
the 68132
State 68367
of 68449
everything 69172
like 69295
military 69655
material 70322
and 70633
equipment 70659
was 70712
very 70765
plainly 70885
put 71321
and 71400
the 71419
magnitude 71530
of 71580
the 71620
task 71812
of 71849
building 71914
up 72107
a 72167
small 72224
army 72352
out 72382
of 72574
nothing 73212
was 73502
not 74110
blinked 74396
The 74539
governor 74829
spoke 74868
of 75403
the 75427
embarrassment 75462
he 75503
felt 75546
at 75572
every 75847
step 75974
from 76106
the 76162
lack 76335
of 76386
practical 76445
military 76538
experience 76769
in 76805
his 76932
staff 77081
and 77545
of 77586
his 77647
desire 77697
to 77870
have 77923
some 78040
one 78157
on 78208
whom 78348
he 78485
could 78521
properly 78754
throw 78846
the 79003
details 79284
of 79305
military 79474
work 79703
McClellan 80070
showed 80289
that 80345
he 80615
fully 80757
understood 80865
the 81214
difficulties 82208
there 82282
would 82502
be 82824
before 83146
him 83289
and 83332
said 83431
that 83911
no 84128
man 84265
could 84669
wholly 85018
master 85337
them 85413
at 85875
once 85925
although 86022
he 86073
had 86147
confidence 86195
that 86454
if 86567
a 86617
few 86648
weeks' 86931
time 86983
for 87020
preparation 87163
were 87339
given 87375
he 87430
would 87611
be 87702
able 87920
to 87994
put 88032
the 88394
Ohio 88692
division 88725
into 89306
reasonable 89419
form 89553
for 90056
taking 90935
the 92150
field 92606
The 92833
command 93267
was 93406
then 93625
formally 93651
tendered 94975
and 95508
accepted 96415
All 96441
of 96572
us 96638
who 97205
were 97280
present 97536
felt 97706
that 98762
the 99079
selection 100194
was 100261
one 102625
full 103018
of 103153
promise 103597
and 103629
hope 103653
and 103982
that 104079
the 104119
governor 104244
had 104314
done 104347
the 104400
wisest 105001
thing 105355
practicable 105413
at 105484
the 105738
time 105889
The 105959
next 106081
morning 106230
McClellan 106255
requested 106294
me 106583
to 106712
accompany 106776
him 106951
to 106967
the 107012
State 107054
Arsenal 107198
to 107347
see 107389
what 107495
arms 107625
and 107667
material 107852
might 107977
be 108090
there 108309
We 108433
found 108530
a 108568
few 108591
boxes 108650
of 108792
smooth-bore 108922
muskets 108981
which 109141
had 109171
once 109209
been 109344
issued 109446
to 109604
militia 109658
companies 109730
and 109761
had 109831
been 109919
returned 109987
rusted 110229
and 110661
damaged 110774
No 110852
belts 111032
cartridge-boxes 111127
or 111193
other 111255
accoutrements 111597
were 111694
with 111804
them 112184
There 112577
were 112811
two 112975
or 113082
three 113211
smooth-bore 113317
brass 113376
fieldpieces 113632
six-pounders 114002
which 114177
had 114576
been 114876
honeycombed 115130
by 115316
firing 115692
salutes 115950
and 116273
of 116542
which 116796
the 116834
vents 116942
had 117126
been 117470
worn 117919
out 118652
bushed 118682
and 118760
worn 118797
out 119314
again 121372
In 121936
a 122060
heap 122201
in 122332
one 123037
corner 124931
lay 125109
a 125335
confused 125558
pile 125671
of 125849
mildewed 126376
harness 126683
which 126851
had 126926
probably 127058
been 127113
once 127532
used 127547
for 127596
artillery 127637
horses 127680
but 128036
was 128067
now 128145
not 128557
worth 128714
carrying 128754
away 128928
There 129083
had 129146
for 129644
many 130236
years 130345
been 131318
no 131464
money 132678
appropriated 133382
to 133563
buy 133626
military 134290
material 134546
or 134674
even 135381
to 135444
protect 135546
the 135668
little 135956
the 136072
State 136131
had 136267
The 136372
federal 136477
government 136575
had 136631
occasionally 136794
distributed 136883
some 136973
arms 137047
which 137156
were 137342
in 137382
the 137642
hands 137892
of 138075
the 138169
independent 138312
uniformed 138386
militia 138460
and 138502
the 138559
arsenal 138613
was 138719
simply 138918
an 138946
empty 139068
storehouse 139096
It 139560
did 139705
not 140598
take 140849
long 141081
to 141229
complete 141282
our 141480
inspection 141598
At 141751
the 142561
door 142593
as 142633
we 142762
were 142999
leaving 143156
the 143408
building 143593
McClellan 143659
turned 143792
and 144078
looking 145204
back 145331
into 145479
its 145587
emptiness 145830
remarked 146153
half 146516
humorously 147201
and 147492
half 148165
sadly 148235
A 148508
fine 148528
stock 149667
of 150309
munitions 150342
on 151731
which 152433
to 152577
begin 154540
a 154581
great 154700
war 156021
We 156406
went 156946
back 157083
to 157741
the 157927
State 157987
House 158435
where 158524
a 158581
room 158608
in 158658
the 158716
Secretary 158782
of 158848
State's 158954
department 159007
was 159092
assigned 159266
us 159307
and 159384
we 159432
sat 159464
down 159495
to 159547
work 159646
The 159741
first 159865
task 160401
was 160893
to 161178
make 161557
out 161834
detailed 161908
schedules 162081
and 162093
estimates 162106
of 162116
what 162315
would 162339
be 162388
needed 162544
to 162581
equip 162659
ten 162724
thousand 162956
men 164375
for 164587
the 164955
field 165122
This 165251
was 165486
a 165528
unit 166067
which 166271
could 166310
be 166452
used 166925
by 166953
the 167487
governor 167671
and 167805
legislature 167934
in 168345
estimating 168486
the 168667
appropriations 168731
needed 168766
then 169112
or 169537
subsequently 170217
Intervals 170274
in 170654
this 170758
labor 171029
were 171169
used 171484
in 171606
discussing 171877
the 172034
general 172122
situation 172194
and 172285
plans 172659
of 172722
campaign 172911
Before 172936
the 173181
close 173273
of 173361
the 173442
week 173557
McClellan 173626
drew 173820
up 173905
a 174226
paper 174300
embodying 174666
his 174965
own 175029
views 175183
and 175292
forwarded 175466
it 175759
to 176327
Lieutenant-General 176359
Scott 176539
He 176817
read 176856
it 177552
to 177757
me 177920
and 178568
my 178724
recollection 179471
of 179592
it 179669
is 179829
that 179881
he 180295
suggested 180567
two 180797
principal 180909
lines 181359
of 181476
movement 181982
in 664
the 5617
West 7381
--one 13723
to 14360
move 21538
eastward 31338
by 37530
the 44117
Kanawha 47835
valley 55914
with 57641
a 61475
heavy 67828
column 75896
to 75918
co-operate 75934
with 79711
an 84670
army 87807
in 88797
front 95006
of 96416
Washington 97227
the 120903
other 134332
to 144929
march 145405
directly 145588
southward 166171
and 166223
to 168816
open 169120
the 169538
valley 175682
of 176008
the 185037
Mississippi 185344
Scott's 112549
answer 112578
was 32168
appreciative 83410
and 83436
flattering 83415
without 17404
distinctly 20348
approving 178745
his 898
plan 16258
and 19062
I 66060
have 74248
never 155
doubted 65186
that 162322
the 164711
paper 164744
prepared 164694
the 2969
way 163364
for 1124
his 3452
appointment 3584
in 37078
the 42906
regular 79977
army 80224
which 80373
followed 85701
at 94998
so 153912
early 154304
a 162284
day 135493
Footnote 12945
I 78291
am 126658
not 79677
aware 168385
that 173060
McClellan's 18269
plan 69714
of 76727
campaign 131591
has 12712
been 68381
published 69716
Scott's 76729
answer 131881
to 132137
it 11766
is 3656

During 68965
this 70764
week 72043
McClellan 72557
was 72625
invited 74884
to 79858
take 82566
the 86494
command 86729
of 87071
the 87176
troops 87330
to 87571
be 88390
raised 103197
in 103259
Pennsylvania 104293
his 104368
native 112522
State 113009
Some 117746
things 118043
beside 124321
his 128132
natural 128218
attachment 162298
to 78310
Pennsylvania 78501
made 78514
the 80831
proposal 87054
an 87295
attractive 89908
one 92770
to 93089
him 99435
It 100084
was 102604
already 103089
evident 104430
that 110927
the 111168
army 111258
which 112246
might 112361
be 112561
organized 112704
near 113020
Washington 113036
would 113067
be 116128
peculiarly 117672
in 117945
the 118003
public 118
eye 182567
and 173503
would 173756
give 175009
to 177490
its 179951
leading 173540
officers 174629
greater 61155
opportunities 89821
of 90232
prompt 90282
recognition 91471
and 92518
promotion 92646
than 92881
would 93087
be 93159
likely 93353
to 93740
occur 101930
in 118221
the 123121
West 123768
The 123784
close 1726
association 88615
with 1714
the 88603
government 86009
would 86666
also 98934
be 125463
a 139606
source 142988
of 147865
power 151254
if 151274
he 175041
were 152614
successful 50102
and 66639
the 66873
way 66947
to 67405
a 67738
chief 67886
command 67956
would 68094
be 68128
more 68159
open 68257
there 68436
than 68830
elsewhere 68887
McClellan 68986
told 69023
me 69099
frankly 69140
that 69630
if 69844
the 70636
offer 70729
had 70741
come 70782
before 71579
he 72284
had 74068
assumed 74452
the 74838
Ohio 75411
command 83648
he 140805
would 142550
have 143663
accepted 66891
it 68417
but 69058
he 70842
promptly 74881
decided 74910
that 13002
he 14563
was 60862
honorably 61057
bound 61180
to 62465
serve 63291
under 65922
the 95004
commission 108974
he 109010
had 109161
already 109694
received 110336
and 110634
which 110846
like 111229
my 111294
own 146525
was 146748
dated 174832
April 1961
My 71981
own 72438
first 72813
assignment 72912
to 73308
a 104914
military 108866
command 110623
was 110727
during 112452
the 112506
same 112509
week 14473
on 15257
the 38830
completion 142530
of 60693
our 3359
estimates 17338
when 79635
I 80647
was 80713
for 93540
a 117560
few 92628
days 33042
put 35053
in 7238
charge 14588
of 24666
Camp 25008
Jackson 29266
the 30571
depot 45329
of 48500
recruits 48577
which 68255
Governor 77016
Dennison 77395
had 79979
established 86653
in 91434
the 99882
northern 101162
suburb 109708
of 111946
Columbus 112317
and 114185
had 118798
named 124420
in 127092
honor 147202
of 160981
the 173974
first 174606
squelcher 145608
of 145832
secessionism 145909
McClellan 149096
soon 149242
determined 2666
however 147715
that 30690
a 182821
separate 29393
camp 103464
of 16920
instruction 35070
should 54878
be 54933
formed 88942
for 95863
the 133375
troops 137463
mustered 144845
into 144852
the 168573
United 980
States 29055
service 29885
and 129094
should 112244
be 128943
so 129099
placed 181733
as 182093
to 112296
be 160623
free 182498
from 184377
the 104
temptations 182529
and 182766
inconveniences 182670
of 173882
too 79845
close 22014
neighborhood 22041
to 22514
a 22822
large 22879
city 23079
whilst 23092
it 23174
should 23333
also 23605
be 26513
reasonably 30775
well 37965
placed 133542
for 134620
speedy 134939
defence 136540
of 136830
the 137067
southern 137448
frontier 137721
of 138478
the 142263
State 148364
Other 167923
camps 2385
could 131069
be 932
under 21767
state 1777
control 33669
and 66068
used 68412
only 68733
for 70702
the 71195
organization 88666
of 93176
regiments 93955
which 94967
could 95015
afterward 95350
be 95476
sent 95804
to 95877
the 97467
camp 97933
of 98032
instruction 98168
or 98409
elsewhere 98510
Railway 99450
lines 100326
and 118008
connections 128639
indicated 133212
some 133525
point 164026
in 164257
the 173294
Little 173315
Miami 173327
valley 173430
as 173508
the 173673
proper 173858
place 174412
for 174440
such 174608
a 176016
camp 176158
and 176999
Mr 177483
Woodward 178936
the 179084
chief 179305
engineer 179930
of 180138
the 181041
Little 181109
Miami 181126
Railroad 2350
being 131034
taken 3224
into 175959
consultation 3108
suggested 169614
a 99771
spot 4994
on 5151
the 5329
line 12631
of 68376
that 145087
railway 146038
about 160904
thirteen 39187
miles 159901
from 161217
Cincinnati 7498
where 13971
a 95414
considerable 95728
bend 95360
of 95849
the 108585
Little 18137
Miami 18156
River 18262
encloses 18407
wide 18473
and 19223
level 19413
fields 20114
backed 20338
on 20932
the 21073
west 21665
by 21703
gently 21725
rising 21879
hills 132959
I 19027
was 19093
invited 20257
to 20738
accompany 20954
the 21103
general 21827
in 888
making 16248
the 120592
inspection 2152
of 118841
the 62487
site 971
and 976
I 1055
think 1129
we 1146
were 1151
accompanied 1169
by 2413
Captain 18095
Rosecrans 21806
an 21811
officer 22990
who 26990
had 27064
resigned 27157
from 27241
the 28096
regular 28332
army 28602
to 28709
seek 29130
a 29149
career 29208
as 29267
civil 29274
engineer 29342
and 29434
had 29489
lately 29530
been 29645
in 29714
charge 29901
of 29944
some 30024
coal 30029
mines 30094
in 30366
the 30380
Kanawha 30470
valley 30615
Mr 31317
Woodward 31344
was 31493
also 31789
of 31944
the 32213
party 32265
and 32457
furnished 32570
a 32752
special 32915
train 33021
to 33131
enable 33142
us 33172
to 33350
stop 33455
at 33754
as 33861
many 34172
eligible 34276
points 34446
as 34972
it 35632
might 36658
be 36712
thought 36775
desirable 36860
to 37083
examine 37190
There 37240
was 37437
no 37723
doubt 37978
that 38148
the 38171
point 38188
suggested 38204
was 38358
best 39761
adapted 41387
for 42204
our 43736
work 43942
and 43984
although 44112
the 44658
owners 44663
of 44681
the 44835
land 45123
made 45285
rather 45378
hard 45421
terms 45771
McClellan 45801
was 46158
authorized 46193
to 46199
close 46643
a 46862
contract 46930
for 47247
the 47403
use 47659
of 47694
the 47932
military 47943
camp 47953
which 47958
in 48142
honor 48732
of 49150
the 49724
governor 50379
he 50581
named 50696
Camp 50908
Dennison 51127
But 51515
in 54781
trying 65844
to 67035
give 67197
a 67433
connected 68295
idea 69378
of 69537
the 69544
first 69546
military 69549
organization 69612
of 69728
the 75517
State 76002
I 76565
have 76895
outrun 77014
some 77093
incidents 84737
of 131097
those 131410
days 131615
which 131633
are 131693
worth 131753
recollection 131818
From 131870
the 131928
hour 131958
the 132131
call 132145
for 132161
troops 132197
was 132216
published 132293
enlistments 132816
began 132910
and 133950
recruits 136530
were 137629
parading 138436
the 138496
streets 138587
continually 138698
At 138780
the 139050
Capitol 139234
the 139372
restless 108799
impulse 121834
to 129068
be 182501
doing 551
something 2570
military 2632
seized 3164
even 6642
upon 8754
the 9510
members 11078
of 11184
the 12178
legislature 12236
and 12272
a 12528
large 12723
number 12814
of 14927
them 14959
assembled 15208
every 15461
evening 15645
upon 16604
the 16684
east 16779
terrace 18111
of 18121
the 18134
State 18934
House 18941
to 18964
be 19044
drilled 20421
in 20714
marching 21110
and 21836
facing 22873
by 23105
one 23379
or 24102
two 28130
of 28369
their 28816
own 28996
number 31185
who 31351
had 31794
some 32167
knowledge 32518
of 32596
company 32673
tactics 32723
Most 32851
of 33487
the 34355
uniformed 34461
independent 35396
companies 35677
in 36440
the 36589
cities 36809
of 36918
the 37094
State 37285
immediately 37295
tendered 37385
their 37897
services 38310
and 38347
began 38419
to 38496
recruit 38644
their 39280
numbers 39898
to 40827
the 41430
hundred 41591
men 41614
required 42044
for 42860
acceptance 44760
There 45851
was 46868
no 47395
time 49038
to 50572
procure 50653
uniform 50718
nor 51084
was 51229
it 51246
desirable 51267
for 52933
these 54847
independent 55862
companies 55892
had 56251
chosen 56507
their 56510
own 58764
and 59538
would 59723
have 60178
to 60294
change 60313
it 60360
for 62109
that 64222
of 64341
the 66597
United 66640
States 67815
as 67830
soon 67976
as 68049
this 68177
could 68375
be 68388
furnished 68398
For 68430
some 68708
days 68849
companies 68939
could 69086
be 69629
seen 70071
marching 70413
and 70484
drilling 70720
of 70989
which 71002
part 71010
would 74451
be 74614
uniformed 75373
in 75606
some 76239
gaudy 76347
style 76355
such 76461
as 77024
is 77190
apt 77583
to 77812
prevail 77836
in 78143
holiday 78285
parades 78334
in 78431
time 78719
of 78795
peace 78858
whilst 78891
another 79413
part 79663
would 79730
be 79857
dressed 80610
in 80613
the 82088
ordinary 82238
working 82687
garb 82715
of 82825
citizens 83409
of 83482
all 84964
degrees 84991
The 85006
uniformed 85026
files 85030
would 85147
also 85255
be 85377
armed 85414
and 85483
accoutred 87033
the 88344
others 88761
would 88903
be 88940
without 89144
arms 89423
or 89428
equipments 89468
and 89596
as 90290
awkward 90590
a 91272
squad 91427
as 91493
could 91785
well 92648
be 94613
imagined 94934
The 96427
material 97098
however 97215
was 97269
magnificent 98543
and 99108
soon 99199
began 99220
to 99241
take 99269
shape 99340
The 99351
fancy 100634
uniforms 100643
were 101497
left 101951
at 104015
home 106942
and 106954
some 107246
approximation 107662
to 111797
a 112257
simple 113650
and 117471
useful 118699
costume 119345
was 119985
made 120548
The 120623
recent 120626
popular 120639
outburst 120909
in 121389
Italy 121418
furnished 121871
a 121944
useful 122043
idea 122333
and 122983
the 124230
Garibaldi 124243
uniform 127117
of 127810
a 127926
red 128042
flannel 128212
shirt 128217
with 128685
broad 128945
falling 129107
collar 129248
with 129256
blue 129286
trousers 129292
held 129317
by 129334
a 129433
leathern 129503
waist-belt 129515
and 129552
a 129609
soft 129626

for 133447
the 133527
head 133704
was 134202
extensively 134298
copied 134428
and 134542
served 134743
an 135355
excellent 135534
purpose 135570
It 135608
could 136457
be 136554
made 136857
by 137260
the 137794
wives 138619
and 138885
sisters 139041
at 139075
home 139302
and 139338
was 139349
all 139362
the 139369
more 139374
acceptable 139444
for 139500
that 140486
The 141087
spring 141246
was 141321
opening 141338
and 141604
a 141686
heavy 142429
coat 142493
would 142549
not 142675
be 144743
much 145246
needed 145283
so 145452
that 145967
with 146037
some 147465
sort 147681
of 148219
overcoat 148319
and 148427
a 148482
good 148487
blanket 148524
in 148541
an 148710
improvised 148828
knapsack 148871
the 149889
new 150233
company 150268
was 151700
not 151740
badly 151973
provided 152277
The 152448
warm 152506
scarlet 153593
color 153948
reflected 154008
from 154053
their 154066
enthusiastic 154080
faces 154125
as 154589
they 155774
stood 156235
in 156453
line 156853
made 157238
a 157440
picture 157898
that 158576
never 158824
failed 159003
to 159727
impress 160035
the 160494
mustering 160551
officers 160621
with 161095
the 161634
splendid 162509
character 162737
of 163082
the 163094
men 163454
The 163724
officering 165374
of 165830
these 166039
new 166403
troops 166635
was 167908
a 168177
difficult 168531
and 168675
delicate 169798
task 170179
and 170182
so 171113
far 171835
as 172272
company 172608
officers 172622
were 172924
concerned 173012
there 173196
seemed 173711
no 173864
better 174013
way 174749
at 175633
the 175899
beginning 176477
than 176491
to 176592
let 177140
the 177184
enlisted 177536
men 178433
elect 179275
their 179282
own 179424
as 179863
was 180844
in 181001
fact 181450
done 181521
In 181524
most 181544
cases 181549
where 181562
entirely 181565
new 181606
companies 181609
were 181820
raised 181825
it 181838
had 181920
been 181993
by 182043
the 182045
enthusiastic 182279
efforts 182503
of 182649
some 182837
energetic 185312
volunteers 56228
who 131349
were 134044
naturally 157967
made 170489
the 170601
commissioned 170984
officers 171380
But 171808
not 174921
always 176733
There 179218
were 1614
numerous 80985
examples 125046
of 12171
self-denying 80919
patriotism 87068
which 99175
stayed 144841
in 166144
the 181690
ranks 182252
after 39378
expending 5791
much 18459
labor 20203
and 20538
money 39390
in 51203
recruiting 53332
modestly 67816
refusing 68399
the 69609
honors 75946
and 78144
giving 89429
way 92512
to 133506
some 139710
one 150284
supposed 153691
to 181695
have 60571
military 80188
knowledge 88879
or 88884
experience 18213
The 34532
war 124246
in 158358
Mexico 162387
in 174962
was 176280
the 177935
latest 177970
conflict 178009
with 178618
a 180894
civilized 69506
people 69619
and 69939
to 70062
have 96731
served 145579
in 14980
it 120663
was 37397
a 75535
sure 158931
passport 59544
to 64245
confidence 64298
It 64354
had 99722
often 124103
been 124530
a 160279
service 169673
more 59539
in 64223
name 64343
than 104016
in 105706
fact 106272
but 106645
the 1865
young 98495
volunteers 104818
felt 105429
so 105771
deeply 105806
their 105863
own 106005
ignorance 106197
that 106290
they 106433
were 106621
ready 14365
to 35955
yield 35989
to 36111
any 36158
pretence 36204
of 36449
superior 51490
knowledge 51572
and 51885
generously 94373
to 131588
trust 131746
themselves 132442
to 132500
any 132694
one 131925
who 132089
would 132203
offer 132263
to 132417
lead 132593
them 173744
Hosts 71166
of 71418
charlatans 71464
and 157793
incompetents 157823
were 157853
thus 158702
put 172098
into 173180
responsible 167350
places 720
at 3295
the 3610
beginning 36078
but 79895
the 722
sifting 3297
work 3612
went 13988
on 94526
fast 126493
after 126558
the 126588
troops 127250
were 127288
once 143056
in 175827
the 180242
field 87755
The 126519
election 70072
of 8309
field 131334
officers 2817
however 152851
ought 155819
not 156279
to 156444
have 156640
been 126586
allowed 127287
Companies 108179
were 108401
necessarily 109316
regimented 109541
together 107355
of 108264
which 108365
each 109528
could 110276
have 825
but 9883
little 13931
personal 60179
knowledge 109834
of 107268
the 107309
officers 108312
of 109773
the 109906
others 68744
intrigue 90115
and 17488
demagogy 58922
soon 75928
came 121485
into 121610
play 121635
and 121678
almost 140865
fatal 749
mistakes 2654
were 3324
made 5530
in 5797
selection 6656
After 6897
a 16357
time 16375
the 16388
evil 16499
worked 17409
its 17466
own 18126
cure 21107
but 22491
the 27208
ill 31616
effects 31747
of 31820
it 39263
were 53101
long 53278
visible 56014
The 77802
immediate 119412
need 119621
of 128005
troops 133459
to 133888
protect 134366
Washington 134392
caused 135589
most 140827
of 144800
the 145064
uniformed 146979
companies 147703
to 148868
be 149025
united 156270
into 156351
the 156457
first 156817
two 157744
regiments 166653
which 166666
were 2764
quickly 152798
despatched 154221
to 16444
the 16614
East 16782
It 17647
was 18356
a 18650
curious 19018
study 20424
to 20592
watch 140583
the 173175
indications 59947
of 13018
character 60935
as 63909
the 13932
officers 14094
commanding 60180
companies 143809
reported 159887
to 826
the 9884
governor 28370
and 59724
were 59746
told 60493
that 60524
the 61722
pressing 66472
demand 83664
from 84178
Washington 86243
made 86309
it 92649
necessary 92685
to 119706
organize 124124
a 148062
regiment 159004
or 159431
two 159627
and 159728
forward 162767
them 162780
at 163071
once 169680
without 170180
waiting 171441
to 172609
arm 172623
or 172731
equip 180625
the 3065
recruits 146578
Some 169571
promptly 169742
recognized 170145
the 2875
necessity 157546
and 15714
took 15922
the 16562
undesirable 16744
features 21844
as 22921
part 22945
of 23443
the 29231
duty 61157
they 134633
had 174710
assumed 181492
Others 60595
were 123848
querulous 2974
wishing 163369
some 165006
one 28776
else 42128
to 71047
stand 74309
first 107358
in 107688
the 107944
breach 108031
leaving 108120
them 108221
time 108270
for 108595
drill 109197
equipment 109307
and 109928
preparation 110316
One 110337
figure 110591
impressed 110678
itself 110748
very 110782
strongly 111227
on 106791
my 107299
memory 108005
A 108044
sturdy 109156
form 109169
a 110102
head 110637
with 1945
more 104898
than 174038
ordinary 174789
marks 175613
of 176215
intelligence 176805
but 177360
a 178165
bearing 178381
with 178542
more 178685
of 181128
swagger 181233
than 3146
of 175881
self-poised 185042
courage 170042
yet 108640
evidently 75325
a 79851
man 80534
of 176032
some 141963
importance 71727
in 158515
his 23101
own 142526
community 10893
stood 2
before 50
the 182511
seat 182675
of 182810
the 182971
governor 183073
the 183160
bright 183340
lights 183377
of 183385
the 183430
chandelier 183505
over 183920
the 183961
table 183977
lighting 184151
strongly 184177
both 184284
their 184840
figures 184865
The 184895
officer 184901
was 184954
wrapped 185059
in 185277
a 185438
heavy 182663
blanket 182782
or 182823
carriage 182844
lap-robe 182857
spotted 182909
like 182930
a 183016
leopard 183044
skin 183063
which 183090
gave 183173
him 183186
a 183200
brigandish 183229
air 183310
He 183357
was 183368
disposed 183447
to 183537
protest 183552
If 183593
my 183624
men 183646
were 183689
hellions 183729
said 183752
he 183808
with 183832
strong 183859
emphasis 183881
on 183905
the 184018
word 184053
a 184110
new 184124
one 184163
to 184200
me 184206
I 184293
wouldn't 184302
mind 184672
but 184692
to 184729
send 184741
off 184756
the 184758
best 184827
young 184855
fellows 185064
of 185316
the 185329
county 185352
in 185363
such 185429
a 184820
way 181682
looks 23050
like 23086
murder 23191
The 23227
governor 24983
sitting 25009
with 69518
pale 71742
delicate 74244
features 135486
but 139417
resolute 139423
air 2318
answered 12173
that 20314
the 21095
way 30223
to 30318
Washington 32338
was 35286
not 35394
supposed 43917
to 43953
be 44009
dangerous 44100
and 47459
the 47685
men 47763
could 49582
be 49681
armed 49753
and 49767
equipped 51118
he 55313
was 55371
assured 55489
as 67817
soon 68308
as 69561
they 69770
reached 69830
there 71136
It 71168
would 71222
be 71466
done 72152
at 72337
Harrisburg 74176
if 76891
possible 77001
and 77237
certainly 79702
if 83064
any 85351
hostility 86644
should 93428
be 93475
shown 96326
in 99756
Maryland 99782
The 99854
President 101475
wanted 103735
the 104184
regiments 107344
at 108588
once 110627
and 131002
Ohio's 131544
volunteers 131583
were 131742
quite 132791
as 133071
ready 138736
to 139382
go 144851
as 164473
any 164917
He 164975
had 164989
no 165026
choice 165040
therefore 121827
but 184325
to 182080
order 112234
them 121392
off 128931
The 129091
order 151743
was 160566
obeyed 182081
but 1567
the 80938
obedience 2710
was 152744
with 53043
bad 86166
grace 87221
and 104632
I 123707
felt 127895
misgivings 154753
as 156533
to 170411
the 180109
officer's 91970
fitness 92780
to 93200
command 93426
--misgivings 98482
which 99740
about 101181
a 101217
year 102859
afterward 103676
were 104094
vividly 111143
recalled 120226
with 175701
the 103952
scene 137710
I 17892
have 178744
described 1611
No 2208
sooner 2303
were 2360
these 11776
regiments 50106
off 59804
than 66598
companies 66624
began 75859
to 75990
stream 76026
in 76064
from 76348
all 76462
parts 78466
of 79877
the 80611
State 80982
On 81792
their 82239
first 82462
arrival 83880
they 83919
were 84230
quartered 84244
wherever 84325
shelter 85256
could 85342
be 85675
had 85832
as 86116
there 86269
were 86455
no 86484
tents 86491
or 86671
sheds 86780
to 86816
make 86998
a 87111
camp 87214
for 87505
them 87804
Going 87924
to 88336
my 90066
evening 93833
work 118897
at 122984
the 124920
State 125044
House 125618
as 125670
I 125712
crossed 126898
the 127141
rotunda 130987
I 131044
saw 131321
a 131347
company 133164
marching 133311
in 133444
by 133528
the 133705
south 134543
door 135645
and 137165
another 139038
disposing 142676
itself 142715
for 145247
the 147495
night 157903
upon 158584
the 158814
marble 158995
pavement 159346
near 159585
the 159792
east 161096
entrance 161138
as 161651
I 161812
passed 161863
on 162510
to 162584
the 170481
north 170522
hall 170565
I 170621
saw 171106
another 171188
that 171307
had 171544
come 171590
a 172127
little 172294
earlier 172685
holding 173031
a 174661
prayer-meeting 174723

stone 176816
arches 176952
echoing 177537
with 177912
the 178439
excited 179139
supplications 179606
of 179728
some 180598
one 180812
who 180886
was 66699
borne 78335
out 79715
of 84184
himself 85792
by 88035
the 157931
terrible 158073
pressure 159224
of 159241
events 170947
around 172273
him 175111
whilst 176286
mingling 177728
with 177766
his 177808
pathetic 178366
beseeching 179832
tones 3176
as 175911
he 2878
prayed 157549
for 143808
his 144818
country 166904
came 63676
the 22016
shrill 23607
notes 91495
of 1728
the 88617
fife 91709
and 91899
the 92525
thundering 96627
din 99470
of 110853
the 110922
inevitable 126212
bass 134277
drum 134313
from 136034
the 136091
company 165193
marching 165211

In 129479
the 129490
Senate 68837

a 98113
company 116246
was 116837
quartered 116901

the 163611
senators 1742
were 2077
there 31772
supplying 41233
them 41283
with 88631
paper 93386
and 93535
pens 93596
with 93792
which 93898
the 99807
boys 99834
were 100057
writing 101249
their 101525
farewells 102811
to 104163
mothers 104323
and 104365
sweethearts 111440
whom 116750
they 116777
hardly 118040
dared 118240
hope 123118
they 125412
should 134274
see 8188
again 2138
A 118827
similar 166745
scene 167252
was 167340
going 167608
on 81570
in 81664
the 84350
Representatives' 85845

the 19546

the 39392
unwonted 39416
noises 54930
when 106507
the 143815
door 150286
was 158577
opened 158631
breaking 166040
in 176764
on 177438
the 105632
quiet 150300
business-like 158661
air 177399
of 60697
the 159685

himself 36728
to 43720
the 75510
wilful 76551
democracy 131595
of 145205
our 178572
institutions 122063
which 178666
insists 36485
upon 71281
seeing 71342
the 71369
man 77667
in 89426
chief 90602

take 91132
its 91175
answer 91425
from 95145
a 95252
subordinate 95712
until 95776
in 181693
the 181716
small 182255
hours 182280
of 95449
the 95523
night 95550
the 1723
noises 88612
were 125461
hushed 571
and 4035
after 4318
a 4606
brief 5187
hour 5211
of 5869
effective 5910
undisturbed 6529
work 8100
upon 8219
the 9102

of 9380
chief 9428

the 10003
glare 10349
of 11115
his 11564
gas-lighted 11673
office 11760
and 11792
seek 11816
a 11854
few 12209
hours' 12492
rest 12558
only 12673
to 14170
renew 14340
the 14554
same 14620
wearing 14672
labors 14787
on 14824
the 15453
morrow 16730
On 16801
the 17103
streets 18600
the 18659
excitement 19388
was 19520
of 20140
a 20168
rougher 20231
if 20272
not 20705
more 20869
intense 20933
character 20994
A 21554
minority 24122
of 25436
unthinking 26376
partisans 27445
could 30776
not 31281
understand 32000
the 32020
strength 32067
and 32098
sweep 33215
of 33828
the 34053
great 34072
popular 34214
movement 34259
and 34514
would 34627
sometimes 34653
venture 35937
to 37324
speak 37718
out 37744
their 37792
sympathy 38175
with 38610
the 38646
rebellion 38769
or 38802
their 38877
sneers 38956
at 39147
some 39277
party 39450
friend 39476
who 39925
had 40184
enlisted 40234
In 40358
the 40373
boiling 40555
temper 41438
of 41540
the 42917
time 44156
the 44197
quick 44364
answer 45046
was 45492
a 45695
blow 45889
and 45981
it 46881
was 47107
one 47339
of 47362
the 47745
common 47787
incidents 48932
of 50525
the 50796
day 50820
for 50842
those 53450
who 53538
came 53830
into 53850
the 54033
State 54095
House 54727
to 54800
tell 57861
of 59563
a 59612
knockdown 59653
that 61164
had 61649
occurred 61675
here 63133
or 65907
there 66006
when 66161
this 66272
popular 67788
punishment 68016
had 68081
been 68173
administered 69962
to 69991
some 70016
indiscreet 70198
rebel 70334
sympathizer 70526
Various 72582
duties 74570
brought 74581
young 74781
army 75573
officers 75643
of 76144
the 76364
regular 78702
service 78820
to 78838
the 78921
state 79269
capital 81087
and 81413
others 81448
sought 81552
a 81562
brief 81602
leave 81645
of 81685
absence 81807
to 81834
come 81866
and 81938
offer 81947
their 82065
services 82137
to 82302
the 82905
governor 83420
of 83993
their 84242
native 84375
State 85732
General 85841
Scott 85932
too 85944
much 85985
bound 86039
up 86087
in 86202
his 86229
experience 86327
of 86517
the 86548
Mexican 86575
War 86661
and 88998
not 89161
foreseeing 91181
the 91207
totally 91306
different 91809
proportions 91874
which 92213
this 93880
must 93992
assume 94096
planted 94346
himself 94466
firmly 95429
on 97061
the 97151
theory 97259
that 97347
the 97617
regular 98329
army 98352
must 98688
be 99259
the 99676
principal 100140
reliance 100645
for 100658
severe 101555
work 101692
and 102021
that 102408
the 102706
volunteers 103540
could 104552
only 106547
be 107145
auxiliaries 107206
around 107261
this 107630
solid 108571
nucleus 109790
which 110053
would 110170
show 110202
them 112880
the 113338
way 114171
to 114914
perform 115280
their 117684
duty 117823
and 118242
take 118958
the 119045
brunt 119162
of 120030
every 120042
encounter 120069
The 120156
young 120288
regulars 120341
who 120369
asked 120588
leave 120657
to 120708
accept 120735
commissions 120754
in 120865
state 121005
regiments 122015
were 122109
therefore 122161
refused 122245
and 122847
were 122916
ordered 122937
to 123013
their 123153
own 123309
subaltern 123344
positions 123650
and 123669
posts 124840
There 124855
can 124881
be 125071
no 125185
doubt 125218
that 125283
the 125288
true 125343
policy 125369
would 125384
have 125407
been 125434
to 125484
encourage 126074
the 126799
whole 126820
of 126878
this 126978
younger 127013
class 128133
to 129285
enter 129536
at 129756
once 129773
the 130408
volunteer 130450
service 130557
They 130874
would 130894
have 131858
been 132159
the 133534
field 133571
officers 133629
of 133709
the 133733
new 133811
regiments 134430
and 134764
would 135003
have 135699
impressed 135816
discipline 135920
and 136147
system 136944
upon 137402
the 137900
organization 138969
from 139760
the 139853
beginning 139977
The 140034
Confederacy 140170
really 140306
profited 142349
by 143183
having 143643
no 148429
regular 149554
army 150126
They 150323
gave 150618
to 150656
the 151207
officers 151227
who 152372
left 152481
our 152538
service 152879
it 152900
is 152925
true 153122
commissions 153219
in 153257
their 153401
so-called 153464
provisional 153518
army 153602
to 154598
encourage 154834
them 156336
in 156347
the 156609
assurance 157624
that 157656
they 157694
would 157990
have 158024
permanent 158485
military 158687
positions 158851
if 158901
the 158922
war 159269
should 159310
end 159613
in 160725
the 160795
independence 160850
of 160935
the 160988
South 161016
but 161044
this 161351
was 161496
only 161585
a 161714
nominal 162438
organization 163040
and 163694
their 163760
real 163934
army 164162
was 164173
made 164207
up 164267
as 164298
ours 164370
turned 164604
out 165147
practically 165302
to 166854
be 166905
from 167348
the 167565
regiments 167609
of 168001
state 168029
volunteers 168104
Less 168446
than 168698
a 169202
year 169256
afterward 169393
we 170199
changed 170336
our 170451
policy 170936
but 171138
it 171424
was 171458
then 171631
too 171903
late 172752
to 172839
induce 173677
many 174370
of 174995
the 176291
regular 176515
officers 176612
to 176861
take 177280
regimental 177477
positions 177560
in 177579
the 177594
volunteer 177628
troops 178360
I 178372
hesitate 178386
to 179011
declare 179505
that 179564
this 179698
did 179783
not 179845
turn 179954
out 180790
for 180936
the 87820
best 87896
for 153566
although 80046
the 93405
organization 93606
of 99778
our 101536
army 104299
would 118034
have 78302
been 87060
more 17621
rapidly 181969
perfected 89564
there 118657
are 125585
other 18122
considerations 55312
which 60295
have 70990
much 17505
weight 18572
The 27299
army 28612
would 30092
not 43077
have 49417
been 62204
the 63575
popular 68278
thing 91492
it 95101
was 95275
its 97746
close 97817
identification 103737
with 103884
the 106571
people's 109617
movement 166527
would 173451
have 160572
been 92141
weakened 70991
and 72117
it 72160
perhaps 72210
would 73552
not 74615
so 74716
readily 74729
have 71775
melted 71908
again 72482
into 73298
the 157773
mass 172928
of 172941
the 1274
nation 56653
at 18902
the 20422
close 20484
of 20584
the 20715
war 20767
Among 20812
the 20854
first 49369
of 49409
the 49574
young 57988
regular 79094
officers 79250

there 101589
as 103736
inspection 104185
and 108018
mustering 108239
officer 108740
and 110628
one 118125
of 131865
my 162301
earliest 2072
duties 20545
was 78778
to 78962
accompany 85352
him 86645
to 93429
Camp 93476
Jackson 95989
to 96327
inspect 96568
the 97682
cooked 98467

which 101476
the 104352
contractors 104377
were 107345
furnishing 108034
the 108589
new 110657
troops 111435
I 116738
warmed 117726
to 118075
his 118105
earnest 118152
breezy 1550
way 73843
and 24259
his 24287
business-like 33071
activity 34925
in 35638
performing 39777
his 40933
duty 42606
As 43225
a 43347
makeshift 165807
before 165909
camp 40767
equipage 165832
and 165866

could 5995
be 11720
issued 12246
to 12303
the 12382

the 14477

placed 15264
long 17086
trestle 18577
tables 20306
under 20461
an 21378
improvised 26617
shed 27145
and 31365
the 31380
soldiers 31457
came 33415
to 34187
these 37299
and 37456
ate 37813
as 38843
at 38951
a 38974
country 39005
picnic 39504
It 40215
was 40581
not 40878
a 42958
bad 44318
arrangement 44346
to 45549

over 48358
the 48751

and 67903
regular 68329
soldiers' 70140

and 70239
the 74772
outcry 79292
about 79767
it 82864
at 83400
the 83501
time 83593
was 83753
senseless 83877
as 84040
all 87190
of 88149
us 88936
know 89011
who 89142
saw 95069
real 95168
service 95499
afterward 99025
McCook 99697
bustled 103026
along 106200

in 165041
the 165375

excellent 166193

as 166589
a 167665
way 167676
of 167949
supporting 168056
an 168159
army 168186
it 168206
was 168354
quite 168433
too 171277
costly 165472
to 165487
last 165661

While 168130
mustering 168325

McCook 3007
was 163402

the 2791
First 2819
Regiment 142370
Ohio 152825
Volunteers 152853
which 155501
had 155628
I 156768
believe 3266
already 3272
gone 50075
to 65836
Washington 66071
He 68345
was 68469
eager 150048
to 158367
accept 164110
and 164128
telegraphed 173046
to 173845
Washington 173999
for 174717
permission 174731
Adjutant-General 176001
Thomas 176007
replied 177149
that 177515
it 179116
was 179350
not 179965
the 180607
policy 181293
of 141962
the 6662
War 53331
Department 75945
to 83441
permit 153690
it 157080
McCook 97672
cut 99734
the 103827
knot 108043
in 108561
gallant 124249
style 101501
He 103720
immediately 104127
tendered 104210
his 107577
resignation 107752
in 1836
the 65220
regular 77191
army 83308
taking 87044
care 88465
to 88512
say 90143
that 90246
he 98460
did 98936
so 98979
not 99109
to 99200
avoid 99242
his 99341
country's 99352
service 101963
or 102054
to 102653
aid 102842
her 103079
enemies 103195
but 103251
because 103511
he 103590
believed 103646
he 103660
could 103754
serve 103839
her 103944
much 104490
more 104547
effectively 104789
by 105021
drilling 105156
and 105233
leading 105325
a 105691
regiment 107121
of 107473
Union 108548
volunteers 108699
He 108938
notified 109033
the 109041
governor 110052
of 110157
his 110582
acceptance 113001
of 113584
the 116124
colonelcy 117893
and 118203
his 124096
coup-de-main 127578
was 128452
a 147969
success 180351
for 180412
the 1846
department 89231
did 96500
not 97984
like 98548
to 98581
accept 98850
a 99011
resignation 100190
under 100195
such 100534
circumstances 101989
and 102558
he 102595
had 103225
the 103491
exceptional 103983
luck 104062
to 104117
keep 104799
his 104943
regular 105197
commission 105286
and 105378
gain 106769
prestige 107091
as 107411
well 107448
by 107537
his 108489
bold 109021
energy 109556
in 109615
the 110060
matter 110189
Orlando 110520
Poe 111540
came 112665
about 112690
the 122577
same 127687
time 130329
for 150340
all 1819
this 99587
was 3476
occurring 55314
in 55429
the 55471
last 55517
ten 55548
days 55591
of 55626
April 55366
He 55613
was 137132
a 133374
lieutenant 83444
of 7801
topographical 2542
engineers 4556
and 4735
was 5823
stationed 6429
with 7291
General 8317
then 8695
Captain 20555
Meade 20633
at 20701

upon 80128
the 88927
coast 95347
survey 95670

He 98177
was 98250
in 122808
person 137033
the 137378
model 140458
for 141729
a 142885
young 143164
athlete 144290
tall 144332
dark 144372
and 144467
strong 144506
with 144521
frank 145291
open 153528
countenance 169785
looking 1052
fit 29127
to 144589
repeat 63377
his 143258
ancestor 88975
Adam 18830
Poe's 103710
adventurous 120083
conflicts 183717
with 57985
the 95203
Indians 33352
as 175475
told 71003
in 34623
the 176137
frontier 60296
traditions 60349
of 29784
Ohio 33494
He 37185
too 164004
was 173225
eager 143832
for 179158
service 26244
but 94592
the 145076
same 21061
rule 29771
was 31942
applied 37183
to 51238
him 162
and 226
the 262
argument 323
that 331
the 343
engineers 359
would 456
be 513
especially 709
necessary 3284
to 4009
the 4022
army 4216
organization 4265
kept 4272
him 4386
for 4712
a 4720
time 4727
from 4848
insisting 4996
upon 5078
taking 5094
volunteer 5100
service 5106
as 5119
McCook 5240
had 5260
done 5280
He 5301
was 5382
indefatigable 5516
in 5542
his 5572
labors 5587
assisting 5601
the 5607
governor 5644
in 5666
organizing 5693
the 5717
regiments 5723
smoothing 5810
the 5824
difficulties 6040
constantly 6598
arising 6623
from 6880
lack 7078
of 7093
familiarity 7226
with 8123
the 8241
details 8263
of 8319
the 8323
administrative 8349
service 8356
of 9009
the 9137
army 9340
and 9651
giving 9665
wise 9708
advice 9807
to 9825
the 9909
volunteer 10272
officers 10303
who 10376
made 10385
his 10424
acquaintance 10451
I 10499
asked 10570
him 10601
one 10671
day 10695
in 10865
my 11138
pursuit 11173
of 11175
practical 11206
ideas 11285
from 11508
all 11939
who 12421
I 12685
thought 12950
could 12986
help 12994
me 13021
what 14286
he 14311
would 14354
advise 14362
as 14395
the 14595
most 14597
useful 14702
means 14929
of 14933
becoming 15203
familiar 15371
with 15411
my 15429
duties 15443
Study 15473
the 15605
Army 15614
Regulations 15624
said 15719
he 15732
as 15736
if 15744
it 17678
were 18734
your 18855
Bible 21895
There 21909
was 21933
a 22047
world 22125
of 22279
wisdom 22309
in 22468
this 22556
much 22802
more 22876
than 22929
I 23027
appreciated 23152
at 23175
the 23205
time 23278
though 23296
it 23311
set 23314
me 23674
earnestly 23689
to 24223
work 25320
in 25842
a 26001
right 26036
direction 26065
An 26182
officer 26708
in 26726
a 26735
responsible 26809
command 26871
who 26980
had 26987
already 26993
a 27006
fair 27030
knowledge 27037
of 27068
tactics 27118
might 27153
trust 27219
his 27300
common 27387
sense 27406
for 27470
guidance 27557
in 27573
an 27586
action 27623
on 27636
the 27686
field 27768
but 27833
the 27890
administrative 27926
duties 28112
of 28121
the 28465
army 28544
as 28559
a 28752
machine 29011
must 29040
be 30383
thoroughly 30609
learned 30722
if 31813
he 31864
would 32131
hope 32387
to 32646
make 32745
the 32889
management 32917
of 33238
its 33279
complicated 33308
organization 33570
an 33581
easy 33741
thing 33930
to 33959
him 34005
Major 34193

came 34469
to 34481

McCook's 34845

of 35692

age 36062
and 36086
more 36108
varied 36159
experience 36192
than 36229

have 36412
named 36605

the 36850

and 36952
possibly 36982
others 36991

I 38114
saw 38200
them 38258
only 38297
in 38326
passing 38349
and 38366
did 38391
not 38395

April 47330
I 47344
was 47351
ordered 47686

The 50745
day 50768
was 50845
a 51482
fair 51702
one 51927
and 51959
when 51998
about 52290
noon 52407
our 52475
railway 52797
train 52905
reached 52911
the 52959
camping 52963
ground 52973
it 53004
seemed 53077
an 53166
excellent 53173
place 53191
for 53241
our 53271
work 53433
The 53439
drawback 53445
was 53621
that 53641
very 53997
little 54042

with 57119
a 57413
train-load 57746

He 60175
had 60555
with 60574
him 60580
his 60939
compass 60964
and 61096
chain 61137
and 61273

the 62079
help 62618
of 62648
a 62778
small 62790
detail 62874
of 63033
men 63060
soon 63068
laid 63072
off 63075

for 63253
the 63365

It 66803

McClellan's 67005
purpose 67221
to 67383
put 67409
in 67464
two 69182
brigades 69405
on 69645
the 69663

on 71875
the 72255

My 72422

was 72755
assigned 72798

The 74656
men 75465
of 75506

shouldered 76154
their 76230
pine 76292

carried 76526
them 76587
up 76956

of 77095
the 77101

along 80744
the 81177
railway 81386
A 81400
general 81407
plan 81482
was 81517
given 81676
to 81890
the 82056
company 82089
officers 82094
by 82101
which 82107
the 82124
huts 82518
should 82570
be 82578
made 82596
uniform 82784
in 82786
size 83003
and 83014
shape 83079
The 83104
huts 83230
of 83335
each 83362
company 83384
faced 83394
each 83471
other 83476
three 83529
or 83533
four 83549
on 83677
each 84129
side 84286
making 84288
the 84597
street 84720
between 84732
in 84873
which 84986
the 85073
company 85114
assembled 85122
before 85517
marching 85522
to 85532
its 85560
place 85599
on 85639
the 85644
regimental 86943
color 87085
line 87722
At 87745
the 87752
head 88038
of 88096
each 88542
street 88674
were 88755
the 88791
quarters 88906
of 88982
the 89005
company 89048
officers 89072
and 89076
those 89108
of 89137
the 89178
field 89214
and 89244
staff 89250
still 89277
further 89319
in 89348
rear 89554
The 89695
Regulations 89989
were 90271
followed 90286
in 90387
this 90457
plan 90474
as 90514
closely 90531
as 90683
the 90723
style 90787
of 90796
barracks 90831
and 90881
nature 90952
of 91070
the 91089
ground 91201
would 91656
permit 91778
Vigorous 91799
work 91801
housed 91805
all 91814
the 91859
men 91926
before 91937
night 92175
and 92623
it 92635
was 92644
well 92671
that 92678
it 92784
did 92818
so 92824
for 92859
the 93929
weather 94014
changed 94034
in 94067
the 94111
evening 94141
a 94148
cold 94249
rain 94302
came 94327
on 94350
and 94439
the 94443
next 94456
morning 94504
was 94534
a 94540
chill 94548
and 94560
dreary 94566
one 94595
My 94607
own 94616
headquarters 94645
were 94673
in 94728
a 94749
little 94769
brick 94777
schoolhouse 94837
of 95016
one 95102
story 95537
which 95792
stood 96343
and 96706
I 96734
think 96789
still 97070
stands 97092
on 97105
the 97116
east 97201
side 97210
of 97282
the 97428
track 98101
close 98309
to 98873
the 98891
railway 99090
My 99136
improvised 99157
camp 99356
equipage 99372
consisted 100544
of 100625
a 100630
common 100664
trestle 100891
cot 100909
and 101941
a 101949
pair 102002
of 102064
blankets 102134
and 102144
I 102157
made 102191
my 102216
bed 102357
in 103012
the 103163
open 103787
space 104486
in 104535
front 110010
of 110042
the 111748
teacher's 111828
desk 112089
or 112185
pulpit 113199
My 113215
only 113246
staff 113321
officer 113329
was 113379
an 113394
aide-de-camp 113503
Captain 113516
Bascom 113644
afterward 114384
of 114534
the 114802
regular 115218
army 115884
who 116147
had 116956
graduated 117238
at 117338
an 117778
Eastern 117849
military 117900
school 118429
and 118471
proved 118919
himself 118936
a 118941
faithful 119123
and 119315
efficient 119362
assistant 119512
He 119577
slept 119762
on 119766
the 119788
floor 119811
in 120198
one 120208
of 120262
the 120317
little 120427
aisles 120440
between 120443
the 120475
pupils' 120496
seats 120519
One 120542
lesson 120567
learned 120569
that 120618
night 120820
remained 120906
permanently 120927
fixed 121061
in 121074
my 121079
memory 121086
and 121131
I 121139
had 121219
no 121296
need 121316
of 121328
a 121835
repetition 121897
of 121989
it 122339
I 122358
found 122436
that 122446
having 122457
no 122475
mattress 122520
on 122642
my 122731
cot 122792
the 122801
cold 123016
was 123604
much 123607
more 123734
annoying 124702
below 124709
than 124721
above 124723
me 124756
and 124792
that 125562
if 125856
one 126205
can't 126391
keep 126428
the 126455
under 126472
side 126475
warm 126485
it 126516
doesn't 126532
matter 126539
how 126544
many 126553
blankets 126565
he 126602
may 126740
have 126751
atop 126758
I 127095
procured 127098
later 127105
an 127167
army 127177
cot 127190
with 127215
low 127543
legs 127683
the 127948
whole 128191
of 128219
which 128550
could 128675
be 129004
taken 129054
apart 129397
and 129600
packed 129652
in 129721
a 129826
very 129840
small 129846
parcel 129874
and 130361
with 130394
this 130518
I 130741
carried 131140
a 131208
small 131340
quilted 131364
mattress 131398
of 133585
cotton 133675
batting 133687
It 133841
would 134017
have 134028
been 134084
warmer 134132
to 134152
have 134386
made 134425
my 134514
bed 134537
on 134568
the 134573
ground 134828
with 134935
a 135367
heap 135568
of 135722
straw 136222
or 136335
leaves 136401
under 136590
me 136828
but 136852
as 136984
my 137239
tent 137296
had 137521
to 137765
be 137935
used 138221
for 138321
office 138366
work 138402
whenever 138616
a 138648
tent 138694
could 138849
be 138890
pitched 139007
I 139202
preferred 139476
the 139498
neater 139503
and 139702
more 139781
orderly 140117
interior 140151
which 140175
this 140210
arrangement 140213
permitted 140261
This 140294
however 140318
is 140329
anticipating 140514
The 140621
comfortless 141103
night 141148
passed 141173
without 141346
much 141354
refreshing 141688
sleep 142227
the 142314
strange 142685
situation 142706
doing 142823
perhaps 144449
as 144462
much 144931
as 144954
the 144977
limbs 144999
aching 145029
from 145066
cold 145896
to 145903
keep 146052
me 146631
awake 146703
The 146728
storm 146830
beat 146852
through 146895
broken 146897
window-panes 146919
and 147111
the 147207
gale 147236
howled 147373
about 147505
us 147518
but 147777
day 147850
at 147871
last 147887
began 147896
to 147901
break 147965
and 147981
with 148129
its 148406
dawning 148469
light 148478
came 148491
our 148516
first 148655
reveille 148715
in 148749
camp 148795
I 148845
shall 148888
never 148990
forget 150296
the 150517
peculiar 150600
plaintive 151000
sound 151167
of 151181
the 151193
fifes 151288
as 151382
they 151393
shrilled 151400
out 152099
on 152601
the 152687
damp 153428
air 154701
The 154718
melody 154726
was 154754
destined 154761
to 154871
become 154898
very 154904
familiar 154910
but 154926
to 155201
this 155213
day 155233
I 155237
can't 156325
help 156645
wondering 156653
how 156749
it 156851
happened 157013
that 157106
so 157161
melancholy 157204
a 157267
strain 157349
was 159287
chosen 159300
for 159400
the 159409
waking 159440
tune 160635
of 162614
the 162644
soldiers' 162646
camp 166769
The 168943
bugle 169788
reveille 169813
is 170169
quite 170171
different 170185
it 170209
is 170309
even 170638
cheery 170801
and 171130
inspiriting 171151
but 171674
the 177205
regulation 177845
music 177884
for 178636
the 179577
drums 179582
and 179585
fifes 181747
is 181759
better 181857
fitted 181924
to 181942
waken 181944
longings 181974
for 181978
home 182049
and 182074
all 182120
the 182136
sadder 182148
emotions 182152
than 182196
to 182240
stir 182259
the 182265
host 182284
from 182429
sleep 182481
to 182486
the 35979
active 126790
duties 127267
of 126714
the 184375
day 784
I 9842
lay 73804
for 131540
a 847
while 16207
listening 184558
to 849
it 1487
finding 2601
its 3136
notes 16209
suggesting 16496
many 73779
things 147650
and 175871
becoming 184342
a 184372
thread 184559
to 184648
string 184368
my 185125
reveries 2121
upon 118810
as 914
I 21749
thought 1270
of 33179
the 56649
past 23352
which 77924
was 97281
separated 108982
from 111805
me 115317
by 125850
a 128755
great 138170
gulf 138720
the 159465
present 16565
with 16633
its 16663
serious 16759
duties 16934
and 17588
the 18256
future 18294
likely 18631
to 18657
come 19047
to 19101
a 19185
sudden 21128
end 22195
in 31418
the 31954
shock 33536
of 33703
battle 33822
We 34148
roused 34392
ourselves 35014
a 35044
dash 35157
of 35161
cold 35558
water 35688
put 36747
an 36848
end 37536
to 37893
dreaming 40005
we 40951
ate 43863
a 43999
breakfast 44115
from 49469
a 49702
box 50625
of 50655
cooked 50671
provisions 50879
we 66118
had 67149
brought 67985
with 68133
us 68450
and 70713
resumed 70766
the 70886
duty 71401
of 71531
organizing 71621
and 71813
instructing 71850
the 72108
camp 72168
The 72353
depression 72383
which 73503
had 74540
weighed 74869
upon 75428
me 75463
since 75504
the 75547
news 75585
of 75601
the 75912
opening 76163
guns 76336
at 76539
Sumter 76806
passed 76933
away 77587
never 77698
to 77871
return 78486
The 78522
consciousness 79306
of 79728
having 80866
important 82503
work 83333
to 85926
do 86035
and 86083
the 86148
absorption 86196
in 86618
the 86649
work 86984
itself 87164
proved 87376
the 87431
best 87972
of 93626
all 96639
mental 97539
tonics 103630
The 103654
Rubicon 104315
was 104348
crossed 104401
and 105485
from 105890
this 106231
time 106295
out 106713
vigorous 106952
bodily 106968
action 107013
our 107055
wild 107348
outdoor 107496
life 107626
and 107668
the 107978
strenuous 108310
use 108531
of 108569
all 108592
the 108651
faculties 109172
mental 109210
and 109345
physical 109605
in 109659
meeting 109731
the 109832
daily 109920
exigencies 111033
made 111194
up 111256
an 112976
existence 113212
which 113318
in 116835
spite 116943
of 118702
all 118707
its 118718
hardships 126927
and 127638
all 127681
its 128068
discouragements 128929
still 131472
seems 133627
a 134675
most 135445
exhilarating 135669
one 136073
as 136373
I 136632
look 136974
back 137048
on 137157
it 138076
across 138387
a 138461
long 138560
vista 138614
of 138947
years 139069
The 139097
first 141230
of 141481
May 141752
proved 143232
instead 143284
a 143594
true 148509
April 148529
day 152594
of 154582
the 156031
most 156416
fickle 157753
and 157928
changeable 157988
type 158525
Gusts 158582
of 158609
rain 158659
and 158783
wind 158849
alternated 158955
with 159008
flashes 159267
of 159308
bright 159433
sunshine 159496
The 159548
second 159647
battalion 161909
of 162082
the 162094
Third 162117
Regiment 162316
arrived 162340
and 162389
the 162582
work 162660
of 162725
completing 165529
the 166311
cantonments 166453
went 166954
on 167806
The 167935
huts 168487
which 168836
were 169560
half 170275
finished 170760
yesterday 171170
were 172035
now 172123
put 172286
in 172723
good 172937
order 173182
and 173362
in 173627
building 173821
the 174301
new 175030
ones 175293
the 176360
men 176857
profited 179670
by 179830
the 179882
experience 180798
of 181477
their 8105
comrades 21664
We 23118
were 25585
however 27593
suddenly 27767
thrown 33358
into 34831
one 36338
of 42419
those 58538
small 58729
tempests 58974
which 59266
it 60395
is 60800
so 63136
easy 63542
to 64432
get 65887
up 66496
in 72155
a 81648
new 81982
camp 84274
and 84497
which 86490
for 87128
the 87576
moment 93687
always 94759
seems 100105
to 104515
have 104652
an 112374
importance 114632
out 117927
of 118625
all 118664
proportion 123584
to 124018
its 124590
real 124974
consequence 124999
Captain 125171
Rosecrans 125723
as 134466
engineer 135671
was 143448
superintending 143749
the 143820
work 145212
of 146544
building 147279
and 155348
finding 157336
that 159286
the 159601
companies 160202
were 160261
putting 161157
floors 161164
and 162901
bunks 165570
in 166457
their 170392
huts 171294
he 172389
peremptorily 174007
ordered 174902
that 175329
these 175839
should 178015
be 179884
taken 182696
out 182883
insisting 182915
that 183110
the 183271
huts 183443
were 183491
only 183548
intended 184113
to 184392
take 184433
the 184474
place 184506
of 184593
tents 78163
and 110125
give 23239
such 80812
shelter 15909
as 18852
tents 69494
could 80307
give 145982
The 150249
company 162974
and 16494
regimental 18468
officers 29884
loudly 37242
protested 79855
and 94311
the 100818
men 173343
were 139533
swelling 139572
with 52033
indignation 100722
and 222
wrath 4159
Soon 4408
both 5924
parties 6302
were 7661
before 8431
me 8487
Rosecrans 8664
hot 12702
and 12983
impetuous 13698
holding 13901
a 14304
high 14415
tone 14990
and 15423
making 19234
use 21426
of 24445
General 26335
McClellan's 30019
name 30524
in 31622
demanding 31843
as 33918
an 35709
officer 37966
of 38635
his 39043
staff 41483
that 41587
the 42756
floors 42998
should 44871
be 48268
torn 51989
out 53094
and 53265
the 54142
officers 54250
of 54750
the 54997
regiments 56350
held 57036
responsible 57754
for 58139
obedience 58584
to 58852
the 59474
order 59736
that 59812
no 60168
more 61092
should 61452
be 61501
made 62145
He 62278
fairly 64075
bubbled 66318
with 66987
anger 67281
at 68706
the 69180
presumption 70454
of 76981
those 77700
who 77764
questioned 81913
his 82968
authority 84449
As 84785
soon 84819
as 85110
a 85338
little 87592
quiet 88253
could 88461
be 88883
got 88979
I 89093
asked 89433
Rosecrans 89699
if 96601
he 96699
had 97206
specific 98627
orders 98821
from 100435
the 100738
general 101361
that 101946
the 102940
huts 104403
should 104965
have 107938
no 112485
floors 112828
No 113707
he 114532
had 114884
not 116893
but 117486
his 121711
staff 121788
position 123513
as 124271
engineer 124666
gave 125819
him 131116
sufficient 131711
control 133109
of 135389
the 136634
subject 138801
I 138882
said 139323
I 140258
would 141236
examine 141319
the 141787
matter 141984
and 142639
submit 143348
it 144024
to 145559
General 145656
McClellan 146821
and 147979
meanwhile 149746
the 150292
floors 150682
already 150703
built 150994
might 152348
remain 154514
though 155038
no 155123
new 155284
ones 155916
should 156436
be 157071
made 157930
till 158184
the 159197
question 159445
was 159466
decided 159904
I 160349
reported 160878
to 162166
the 162318
general 162662
that 163201
in 163679
my 167105
judgment 167672
the 170135
huts 170160
should 170979
have 172073
floors 172333
and 176806
bunks 177398
because 177517
the 177818
ground 179130
was 180231
wet 182175
when 182269
they 184837
were 27889
built 45009
--they 66459
could 105573
not 106847
be 149012
struck 69491
like 69500
tents 9977
to 62396
dry 65945
and 87533
air 116694
the 3000
earth 15907
and 16681
they 16859
were 18689
meant 18823
to 18914
be 135691
permanent 136009
quarters 150247
for 155795
the 156216
rendezvous 156313
of 162973
troops 163395
for 165451
an 165477
indefinite 165811
time 165904
The 166026
decision 166671
of 169020
McClellan 169164
was 171227
in 176597
accordance 176634
with 181048
the 2991
report 163386
Rosecrans 179077
acquiesced 16695
and 156253
indeed 156377
seemed 156435
rather 166520
to 168901
like 9555
me 59910
the 70175
better 147309
on 69388
finding 69397
that 69670
I 76737
was 142348
not 164980
carried 165032
away 165188
by 173687
the 25091
assumption 45708
of 183971
indefinite 184750
power 184891
by 185053
a 185313
staff 46128
officer 87410
This 50308
little 67059
flurry 101730
over 57599
the 184928
quarters 185243
were 6493
soon 2238
got 126092
in 61177
as 170033
comfortable 15057
shape 137406
as 137387
rough 15178
lumber 20526
could 20569
make 20616
them 20628
and 20672
the 111239
work 1972
of 104925
drill 111233
and 159713
instruction 159731
was 37854
systematized 55280
The 77480
men 165560
were 166440
not 167996
yet 168882
armed 71439
so 308
there 3613
was 4484
no 5276
temptation 5512
to 6379
begin 6650
too 6738
soon 7533
with 7753
the 7924
manual 8183
of 9190
the 10043
musket 10460
and 11451
they 13997
were 14441
kept 14643
industriously 15105
employed 15787
in 15837
marching 16015
in 16033
single 16127
line 16980
by 17590
file 17751
in 20624
changing 20956
direction 21499
in 22209
forming 22754
columns 23243
of 24157
fours 25037
from 25170
double 26788
line 27756
etc 28511
before 28640
their 29020
guns 29161
were 29379
put 29700
in 30998
their 31553
hands 31654
Each 33638
regiment 33707
was 33961
treated 34394
as 36136
a 36554
separate 37503
camp 37844
with 37925
its 38033
own 38697
chain 38756
of 39352
sentinels 40427
and 41013
the 41181
officers 41368
of 42393
the 42630
guard 42815
were 43537
constantly 43610
busy 44839
teaching 45831
guard 46592
and 47249
picket 47309
duty 47559
theoretically 47587
to 49774
the 49874
reliefs 49931
off 50169
duty 50362
and 51668
inspecting 53135
the 56247
sentinels 57367
on 58100
post 58255
Schools 58637
were 58681
established 58720
in 59159
each 59314
regiment 59457
for 59713
field 59848
and 60149

was 63049
in 63203
the 63210
hands 63222
of 63915
everybody 64142
who 64510
could 64548
procure 64733
a 65106
copy 65124
It 65162
was 65269
one 66120
of 67116
our 67550
great 67797
inconveniences 67809
that 67841
the 67873
supply 72211
of 72953
the 73399
authorized 73653
Tactics 75744
was 75796
soon 75848
exhausted 76480
and 77204
it 77325
was 78048
difficult 78356
to 78806
get 79807
the 79832
means 80672
of 80765
instruction 81116
in 81847
the 81997
company 82421
schools 83630
An 83729
abridgment 83826
was 84586
made 85162
and 85910
published 86274
in 87649
a 87667
very 88224
few 88915
days 89233
by 89899
Thomas 90255
Worthington 90496
a 91073
graduate 92089
of 93130
West 93376
Point 93807
in 93829
one 94858
of 95224
the 95965
earliest 96237
classes 96471
--of 96543
I 96876
think 97645
--a 98017
son 98519
of 98539
one 98788
of 98998
the 100204
first 100375
governors 100594
of 101448
Ohio 102233
This 103060
eccentric 103220
officer 103312
had 103420
served 105261
in 105517
the 106784
regular 106925
army 106970
and 107083
in 108339
the 108746
Mexican 109977
War 110098
and 110350
was 110414
full 110703
of 110721
ideas 111074
but 111667
was 112355
of 112605
so 113181
irascible 113305
and 113412
impetuous 114547
a 115529
temper 116070
that 116557
he 117630
was 117998
always 118181
in 118197
collision 119281
with 119382
the 120013
powers 121948
that 122205
be 122411
and 123550
spoiled 123785
his 123841
own 123901
usefulness 124028
He 124196
was 124302
employed 124551
to 124939
furnish 125033
water 125523
to 126409
the 127243
camp 127970
by 128073
contract 128271
and 128357
whilst 128528
he 128607
ruined 128879
himself 129820
in 130144
his 130944
efforts 132242
to 132775
do 133335
it 133485
well 134884
he 135885
was 136507
in 137194
perpetual 137322
conflict 138984
with 139099
the 140123
troops 140546
who 140639
capsized 141202
his 141495
carts 141646
emptied 143242
his 143316
barrels 143698
and 144507
made 145043
life 145314
a 145610
burden 145911
to 145926
him 146434
The 147102
quarrel 147137
was 147563
based 147613
on 148633
his 148819
taking 149246
the 149688
water 149763
from 150011
the 150050
river 151153
just 151359
opposite 151634
the 151934
camp 151974
though 152706
there 153385
was 154434
a 154678
slaughter-house 155439
some 155549
distance 155893
above 158383
Worthington 158785
argued 160145
that 160244
the 160518
distance 161406
was 162018
such 162368
that 162565
the 162727
running 162866
water 163616
purified 164686
itself 164814
but 165496
the 165691
men 165858
wouldn't 166110
listen 166707
to 168737
his 168996
science 169018
vigorously 169311
enforced 170559
as 170576
it 170762
was 170991
by 171037
idiomatic 171172
expletives 171837
and 172990
there 173631
was 173946
no 174069
safety 174585
for 175658
his 175767
water-carts 175799
till 176192
he 176407
yielded 176990
He 177032
then 177381
made 178095
a 178533
reservoir 179352
on 179600
one 180055
of 180090
the 180333
hills 180451
filled 180917
it 182976
by 184784
a 7491
steam-pump 173443
and 55133
carried 61024
the 61036
water 105628
by 108441
pipes 120144
to 124316
the 166264
regimental 169130
camps 169479
at 169498
an 184940
expense 184997
beyond 538
his 22138
means 37296
and 37297
which 51268
as 51269
it 64064
was 69691
claimed 69693
that 70995
the 76751

was 79414
unauthorized 88941
was 92145
never 103934
half 104077
paid 104153
for 108507
His 143676
subsequent 144854
career 165388
as 172854
colonel 181525
of 181545
a 181680
regiment 182504
was 63882
no 148
more 121825
happy 4311
and 6891
talents 9123
that 21097
seemed 68651
fit 68728
for 68841
highest 68907
responsibilities 68972
were 69051
wasted 71600
in 74878
chafing 78363
against 78749
circumstances 79420
which 79837
made 84009
him 84123
and 86176
fate 86640
seem 89297
to 89318
be 89566
perpetually 93448
playing 93532
at 99696
cross 99785
purposes 99829

He 100040
was 100073
later 101523
colonel 101771
of 102807
the 102915
Forty-sixth 104166
Ohio 105408

became 109271
involved 109643
in 118231
a 118256
famous 118274
controversy 118659
with 125587
Halleck 139451

over 70804

to 118268
him 118319
for 118570
I 118631
had 118701
hoped 123148
that 124152
our 124231
close 124367
friendship 125346
would 125389
be 125419
made 125519
still 131394
closer 131459
by 131483
comradeship 136705
in 136916
the 139583
field 140380
In 141088
a 141339
few 141659
weeks 151269
he 169659
was 176323
made 1643

Up 81042
to 84353
the 84511
time 84556
that 84992
General 85236
Bates 89816
relieved 89869
me 90020
of 91502
the 93331
command 93340
of 93512
the 96625
camp 96637
and 99551
indeed 99674
for 101676
two 101714

three 102755
days 102834
longer 102877
the 103415

as 117950
telegraph 118227

office 118374
We 118390
had 118451
cleared 118490
out 123594
most 124868
of 125203
the 125959
desks 125986
and 127955
benches 141247
but 160276
were 177625
still 91398
crowded 88369
together 88691
day 88693
and 88898
night 89229
in 89815
a 90102
way 91110
which 1711
was 88600
anything 80159
but 88709
comfortable 415
or 6697
desirable 43881
Sheds 164970
for 64368
quartermaster's 64384

were 127227

the 17467

longer 74799
ignored 76018
and 76128
my 131602
own 131653

was 133050
built 1067
on 29142
the 1496

here 182824
for 183230
the 183358
next 183431
six 183594
weeks 183625
was 183690
my 183809
home 184019
The 49107
morning 49340
brought 49561
its 49658
hour 49586
of 49614
business 14364
correspondence 15006
relating 19946
to 31782
the 35763

then 35954
came 36448
the 78842
drill 78975
when 95805
the 142309
parade 18502
ground 25018
was 25377
full 25645
of 33041
marching 33104
companies 35052

squads 36502
Officers' 48688

followed 73086
with 77592

The 95565
day 95588
closed 104024
with 115674
the 115681

at 6527

the 161564

themselves 133479

as 137408
Mahan's 137752

adopted 136585
at 138237
the 138428
beginning 12410
a 38685
rule 92323
to 127364

some 176148
military 1370
work 5393
in 17315
course 31754
of 54353
reading 56749
and 66549
kept 66915
it 75748
up 75904
even 82146
in 83638
the 83931

sending 86804

getting 119824
another 120002
by 120130

In 122119
this 122357
way 122505
I 122706
gradually 122880
went 123004
through 123225
all 124112
the 124824

know 178667
of 179808
no 180224
intellectual 2142
stimulus 3936
so 4830
valuable 16349
to 62842
the 67754
soldier 70480
as 87545
the 98961
reading 118831
of 119518
military 120010
history 120602
narrated 123304

an 125938

in 145787
the 154369
art 175197
of 178620
war 2136
To 118825
see 2496
what 140412
others 80271
have 181481
done 183074
in 183921
important 183962
junctures 183978
and 184152
to 184285
have 184841
both 184866
their 184896
merits 184902
and 184955
their 185060
mistakes 185439
analyzed 7016
by 7035
a 7062
competent 133085
critic 167190
rouses 167657
one's 55348
mind 58523
to 76401
grapple 171874
with 173248
the 173595
problem 174191
before 174855
it 77635
and 17376
begets 3256
a 80777
generous 93414
determination 93447
to 93472
try 99724
to 99818
rival 111018
in 114014
one's 118767
own 124247
sphere 160197
of 160233
action 175991
the 177899
brilliant 180406
deeds 80549
of 86637
soldiers 96337
who 97190
have 97377
made 97707
a 98203
name 98472
in 99844
other 100098
times 101491
Then 176354
the 176935
example 177508
of 13597
the 50110
vigorous 71022
way 105038
in 117871
which 36829
history 39741
will 40130
at 41418
last 42498
deal 43497
with 43666
those 1068
who 29143
fail 1102
when 37056
the 18837
pinch 50988
comes 58731
tends 12015
to 2313
keep 42045
a 42106
man 42144
up 43859
to 74697
his 85007
work 130997
and 131425
to 131493
make 131766
him 131785
avoid 131890
the 132295
rock 132330
on 132763
which 132822
so 132845
many 132896
have 132972
split 133035
the 133081
disposition 133293
to 133468
take 133851
refuge 136648
in 136719
doing 136815
nothing 138931
when 139614
he 44195
finds 132107
it 132251
difficult 132511
to 132734
decide 133500
what 135637
should 136868
be 138862
done 139125
The 173478
first 179345
fortnight 180516
in 181082
camp 181445
was 3242
the 175977
hardest 141510
for 86303
the 66059
troops 89293
The 133261
ploughed 133438
fields 158697
became 164458
deep 164506
with 164567
mud 165017
which 165331
nothing 165459
could 165638
remove 166085
but 166307
the 166417
good 166633
weather 47622
which 47751
should 47802
allow 48330
them 48523
to 49792
pack 49955
hard 49988
under 138763
the 166536
continued 25416
tramp 37625
of 22978
thousands 414
of 6696
men 164969
The 175477
organization 68587
of 15074
the 15339
camp 37641
kitchens 152
had 3807
to 71421
be 93744
learned 103649
by 108921
the 110804
hardest 110807
also 112241
and 112791
the 119296
men 128962
in 143665
each 144855
company 145418
who 164918
had 165389
some 172876
aptitude 172884
for 126692
cooking 127066
had 112242
to 128937
be 16208
found 118805
by 126609
a 121400
slow 184566
process 106
of 141
natural 3277
selection 182531
during 127062
which 2932
many 163327
an 1076
unpalatable 1143
meal 1403
had 1701
to 18472
be 37030
eaten 44655
A 65709
disagreeable 88590
bit 1782
of 99550
information 126382
came 126690
to 127064
us 181731
in 182091
the 126198
proof 126763
that 45780
more 166382
than 166419
half 166444
the 166482
men 166495
had 166515
never 166612
had 166734
the 26160
contagious 105477
diseases 106658
of 568
infancy 60910
The 12941
measles 126549
broke 99460
out 124514
and 3774
we 5831
had 9782
to 24258
organize 33070
a 34249
camp 34924
hospital 35637
at 36482
once 37853
A 39776
large 40766
barn 42605
near 42875
by 43224
was 48880
taken 49106
for 49339
this 49560
purpose 49657
and 54005
the 54257
surgeons 54732
had 54809
their 54873
hands 55279
full 56223
of 56235
cases 71408
which 72040
however 74334
trivial 74381
they 92140
might 92303
seem 92383
at 108077
home 142164
were 142369
here 145884
aggravated 166891
into 168287
dangerous 168562
illness 168572
by 156
the 17398
unwonted 66636
surroundings 74696
and 87986
the 88844
impossibility 121823
of 131164
securing 133373
the 146676

protection 151967
from 159100
exposure 173532
As 72556
soon 178671
as 176453
the 138409
increase 138441
of 42391
sickness 70701
in 77949
the 78017
camp 78236
was 78372
known 78646
in 83979
Cincinnati 86500
the 118799
good 126463
women 1538
of 73831
that 1540
city 73833
took 164834
promptly 88479
in 103081
hand 103510
the 106756
task 107115
of 108701
providing 110584
nurses 113002
for 113139
the 103613

of 15964
Sister 46321
Anthony 48472
a 56111
noble 84111
woman 134679
came 145755
out 185111
in 79856
force 94312
and 100819
their 173344
black 37243
and 1702
white 5739
robes 28422
harmonized 54998
picturesquely 66105
with 66588
the 67737
military 68659
surroundings 88591
as 118719
they 124326
flitted 144605
about 144635
under 145386
the 145459
rough 145530
timber 146152
framing 148166
of 148448
the 149050
old 157687

to 108845
another 134249
As 134614
to 140358
supplies 140520
hardly 147879
a 148849
man 167948
in 167998
a 90278
regiment 90285
knew 91436
how 178180
to 1719
make 88608
out 163997
a 56172
requisition 63957
for 64005
rations 123748
or 53725
for 71004
clothing 71011
and 72166
easy 72328
as 72400
it 72664
is 73075
to 73554
rail 74633
at 70999
red 72140
tape 72572
the 75930
necessity 157081
of 150758
keeping 151351
a 8200
check 17827
upon 83125
embezzlement 84194
and 87602
wastefulness 88463
justified 88697
the 90703
staff 93404
bureaus 93605
at 99777
Washington 101535
in 104298
insisting 118033
upon 125196

support 169665
the 148948
quartermaster's 156854

But 91282
here 33106
too 33396
men 36504
were 64066
gradually 163084
found 76
who 10879
had 12229
special 13622
talent 16321
for 16417
the 17440

The 17499
infallible 17569

had 70748
no 70865
lack 71238
of 71537
material 71774
for 74714
criticism 126375
There 128109
were 142580
plenty 145547
of 153157
real 153508
blunders 153876
to 153926
invite 154104
it 158643
but 158791
the 159229
severest 160365
blame 160647
was 162941
quite 163107
as 137133
likely 137163
to 167798
be 85876
visited 848
upon 2116
men 2234
and 126088
things 122334
which 1411
did 1602
not 2240
deserve 2618
it 5793
The 5986
governor 6126
was 6221
violently 6397
attacked 6514
for 6704
things 6812
which 6918
he 7186
had 9913
no 11185
responsibility 11264
for 12356
or 12479
others 12541
in 15545
which 15882
he 16400
had 16619
done 16720
all 17191
that 17243
forethought 17413
and 17670
intelligence 17788
could 18633
do 18930
When 18959
everybody 19106
had 19240
to 19318
learn 19356
a 19707
new 19793
business 19921
it 19992
would 20037
have 20242
been 20283
miraculous 20415
if 20763
grave 21008
errors 21037
had 21331
not 21671
frequently 21814
occurred 22348
Looking 22601
back 22863
at 22874
it 23107
the 23374
wonder 25865
is 26909
that 27077
the 28846
blunders 29683
and 31918
mishaps 37098
had 49857
not 50082
been 50573
tenfold 50654
more 65233
numerous 65717
than 65953
they 66403
were 66424
By 66542
the 66626
middle 66656
of 66663
May 70679
the 77813
confusion 78286
had 78331
given 78393
place 78488
to 79664
reasonable 79731
system 79867
but 79922
we 80012
were 80090
now 80614
obliged 80747
to 80973
meet 81073
the 81229
embarrassments 81324
of 82228
reorganization 82290
for 82399
three 82529
years 82592
under 82671
the 82734
President's 82753
second 82782
call 82816
for 82894
troops 82972
We 83746
had 83772
more 83957
than 84030
ten 84195
thousand 84332
men 84346
who 84569
had 85407
begun 85519
to 85544
know 85802
something 85843
of 85863
their 86099
duties 86109
and 86127
it 86252
was 86373
worth 86431
a 86457
serious 86584
effort 86628
to 86656
transfer 86788
them 86886
into 86947
the 86968
permanent 87002
service 87114
but 87180
no 87199
one 87255
who 87273
did 87288
not 87388
go 87506
through 87564
the 87596
ordeal 88186
can 88338
imagine 88502
how 88789
trying 89466
it 90057
was 91310
In 92795
every 93334
company 93488
some 93628
discontented 93845
spirits 93853
wanted 97543
to 98126
go 98654
home 99838
shrinking 99891
from 100173
the 100234
perils 100603
to 100644
which 100868
they 100920
had 101554
committed 101665
themselves 101689
in 101779
a 101823
moment 101958
of 102274
enthusiasm 102692
For 102924
a 102954
few 103555
to 103578
go 104273
back 104428
however 104627
would 104729
be 108818
a 109720
disgrace 110209
and 110376
every 111502
dissatisfied 112258
man 112674
to 112721
avoid 112842
the 113125
odium 113387
of 113547
going 113610
alone 114671
became 116092
a 116186
mischief-maker 118023
seeking 118217
to 118285
prevent 118372
the 118442
whole 118935
company 118978
from 119260
re-enlisting 119346
The 119439
recruiting 119858
of 120233
a 120346
majority 120678
was 120919
naturally 121175
made 121824
the 121864
condition 121895
of 122055
allowing 122321
the 122363
company 122391
organization 122529
to 122905
be 122985
preserved 123287
and 123300
a 123436
similar 123739
rule 124725
applied 124827
to 124864
the 124926
regiment 125104
The 125275
growing 125310
discipline 125360
was 125410
relaxed 125501
or 125631
lost 125668
in 125789
the 125934
solicitations 126004
the 126094
electioneering 126139
the 126255
speech-making 126355
and 126611
the 126680
other 126815
common 126850
arts 126877
of 126900
persuasion 126923
After 126987
a 127143
majority 127437
had 127474
re-enlisted 127604
and 127734
an 127761
organization 127886
was 127931
secure 127989
it 128066
would 128104
have 128404
been 128489
better 128612
to 128863
have 129160
discharged 129249
the 129257
remaining 129434
three 129581
months' 129755
men 129785
and 129833
to 129891
have 129903
sent 130375
them 131169
home 131270
at 131319
once 142889
but 143662
authority 147667
for 147843
this 147923
could 147961
not 147990
be 148028
got 175096
for 181522
the 181550
civil 1569
officers 1639
could 1788
not 2149
see 3834
and 6628
did 9989
not 10045
know 11079
what 12244
a 15925
nuisance 15932
these 16598
men 18283
were 18606
Dissatisfied 19149
with 19868
themselves 21131
for 21212
not 21513
going 21943
with 21970
their 22162
comrades 22938
they 23170
became 23198
sulky 27131
disobedient 28272
complaining 28398
trying 66669
to 67801
make 75678
the 79887
others 80858
as 80940
unhappy 81010
as 81149
themselves 84525
by 85233
arguing 85505
that 85651
faith 86058
was 86461
not 86529
kept 86923
with 87328
them 87814
and 87955
doing 88121
all 88678
the 89893
mischief 90079
it 93565
was 99556
possible 100106
to 101314
do 101890
In 102325
spite 102596
of 107489
all 110497
these 112067
discouragements 112215
however 112321
the 112639
daily 113031
drills 114410
and 115168
instruction 115814
went 117678
on 117782
with 117913
some 118359
approach 118414
to 118721
regularity 118838
and 119235
our 119770
raw 120085
volunteers 120637
began 121304
to 122068
look 123063
more 123612
like 123946
soldiers 124019
Captain 124107
Gordon 124283
Granger 126369
of 126883
the 127122
regular 127365
army 127528
came 127712
to 127841
muster 128242
the 128346
re-enlisted 128364
regiments 128689
into 128812
the 128910
three 129293
years' 129714
service 130179
and 130212
as 130277
he 130317
stood 133150
at 136055
the 148073
right 969
of 21804
the 2131
Fourth 118820
Ohio 2210
looking 118899
down 1691
the 81062
line 165408
of 165455
a 136062
thousand 9101
stalwart 9228
men 9328
all 9373
in 9604
their 14989
Garibaldi 15014
shirts 18950
for 19056
we 37526
had 38371
not 38427
yet 38509
received 40249
our 40460
uniforms 40521
he 40904
turned 44001
to 44053
me 45060
and 47661
exclaimed 145345
My 159883
God 168289
that 9788
such 37594
men 38239
should 39719
be 40291
food 40919
for 43944
powder 48557
It 776
certainly 3351
was 21352
a 55356
display 55408
of 68770
manliness 68879
and 68899
intelligence 68998
such 70786
as 75392
had 81094
hardly 81460
ever 82630
been 83649
seen 87383
in 87443
the 143673
ranks 69055
of 80552
an 82587
army 82709
There 82963
were 84051
in 84065
camp 87404
at 88454
that 88469
time 88723
three 1458
if 65764
not 14317
four 28105
companies 32137
in 142132
different 30744
regiments 93450
that 93598
were 99772
wholly 100081
made 108735
up 109465
of 110000
undergraduates 93396
of 104286
colleges 109399
who 164495
had 69365
enlisted 69802
together 76676
their 94795
officers 95811
being 141747
their 143812
tutors 145348
and 180685
professors 95855
and 108584
where 9513
there 75872
was 86257
not 103910
so 106955
striking 107479
evidence 108375
as 108423
this 109607
of 110253
the 110437
enlistment 143814
of 160186
the 169679
best 170183
of 177616
our 1881
youth 99380
every 103763
company 103923
could 104834
still 105438
show 105756
that 106633
it 124100
was 151335
largely 169750
recruited 33147
from 33158
the 33697
best-nurtured 39815
and 39850
most 39896
promising 39938
young 43707
men 20713
of 33975
the 37135
community 74837
Granger 78867
had 95892
been 108178
in 131920
the 138320
Southwest 161911
when 2123
the 118812
secession 77025
movement 85378
began 85409
had 85415
seen 179425
the 179479
formation 179998
of 180845
military 179651
companies 184982
everywhere 78847
and 121942
the 17377
incessant 28378
drilling 59739
which 59742
had 60528
been 61783
going 61816
on 152704
all 179160
winter 4633
whilst 5742
we 106140
in 110970
a 142948
strange 32584
condition 71142
of 152434
political 178569
paralysis 8765
had 11532
been 38637
doing 59904
nothing 7731
His 7017
information 7036
was 7063
eagerly 167658
sought 184156
by 185320
us 18838
all 50989
and 162976
he 163699
lost 165031
no 165145
opportunity 168569
of 19061
impressing 92751
upon 92794
us 93015
the 93047
fact 93109
that 93162
the 93928
South 97065
was 100374
nearly 56358
six 13020
months 60937
ahead 63911
of 5
us 63
in 17270
organization 28399
and 32056
preparation 38633
He 59900
did 60736
not 61423
conceal 61531
his 64535
belief 75927
that 143369
we 144368
were 145602
likely 148880
to 159325
find 182514
the 18906
war 71982
a 103964
much 103995
longer 105111
and 105306
more 105515
serious 105728
piece 110271
of 1855
business 43957
than 44050
was 44108
commonly 45074
expected 47666
and 104808
that 105870
unless 105919
we 106615
pushed 111153
hard 2807
our 152841
drilling 155793
and 155992
instruction 156030
we 156452
should 156556
find 156621
ourselves 51230
at 68705
a 68745
disadvantage 68859
in 68877
our 70762
earlier 71602
encounters 133600
What 133926
he 135571
said 135676
had 135782
a 137539
good 139350
effect 139478
in 142446
making 142494
officers 142610
and 142720
men 148711
take 68233
more 70795
willingly 133881
to 135363
the 135593
laborious 136231
routine 137597
of 139404
the 142608
parade 2492
ground 140408
and 143546
the 179154
regimental 145603
school 145924
for 66720
such 184753
opinions 124312
as 146595
his 6585
soon 139066
ran 159253
through 162800
the 176440
camp 184920
and 1430
they 65736
were 144752
commented 179157
upon 60500
by 67832
the 159899
enlisted 163093
men 62764
quite 63675
as 17311
earnestly 81711
as 101741
among 101838
the 128514
officers 133707
Still 134812
hope 89824
kept 90008
the 91481
upper 92225
hand 16449
and 18345
if 78292
the 126659
question 21078
had 66194
been 68243
put 68256
to 68775
vote 136712
I 3424
believe 17432
that 152870
three-fourths 173216
of 173272
us 47441
still 47721
cherished 48007
the 48582
belief 49113
that 131915
a 132100
single 5737
campaign 164423
would 69624
end 69838
the 69936
war 71704
In 71925
the 72068
organization 72178
of 72363
my 72424
own 72733
brigade 72821
I 72936
had 76605
the 76682
assistance 77663
of 77939
Captain 91626
McElroy 91672
a 91831
young 91837
man 91972
who 92051
had 94449
nearly 94519
completed 71551
the 71887
course 71972
at 72018
West 72121
Point 72909
and 73094
who 76639
was 91578
subsequently 92495
made 1747
major 88636
of 165027
the 165093
Twentieth 165130
Ohio 165085
He 2980
was 163375
sent 139538
to 117477
the 144847
camp 117406
by 117496
the 129621
governor 3048
as 68401
a 133208
drill 133508
officer 137435
and 137795
I 144801
assigned 163443
him 164474
to 164762
staff 164789
duty 164995
For 165002
commissary 165061
I 165240
detailed 165314
Lieutenant 165440
Gibbs 165478
who 165819
accompanied 165855
one 165881
of 166054
the 166130
regiments 166175
from 166343
Cincinnati 166490
and 166545
who 166742
had 166981
seen 167116
a 167329
good 167426
deal 167530
of 167651
service 167794
as 167964
clerk 168021
in 168067
one 168314
of 168489
the 169165
staff 169322
departments 169452
of 169641
the 170123
regular 171204
army 171224
I 171572
had 171847
also 172388
for 175130
a 2378

picturesque 135365
adventurers 136238
who 136433
turn 137053
up 137331
in 137736
such 139017
crises 139087
In 150234
the 163356
Seventh 163423
Ohio 164595
was 164709
a 165149
company 165328
recruited 165413
in 165500
Cleveland 165533
of 165924
which 165981
the 166032
nucleus 166279
was 166431
an 166622
organization 167233
of 167726
Zouaves 168443
existing 168597
for 168681
some 168734
time 168763
before 168784
the 168934
war 171692
It 16687
was 16780
made 16841
up 18912
of 19045
young 19074
men 19214
who 20137
had 20254
been 20453
stimulated 21682
by 21700
the 39223
popularity 39249
of 20406
Ellsworth's 176749
Zouaves 178182
in 181043
Chicago 136012
to 156271
form 156352
a 156458
similar 161568
body 166667
They 168899
had 141044
had 141261
as 141518
their 141093
drill 141745
master 141758
a 164198
Frenchman 7314
named 23567
De 52859
Villiers 57055
His 57446
profession 58568
was 137282
that 185404
of 2723
a 30030
teacher 30095
of 31318
fencing 32266
but 47933
he 47959
had 49151
been 69379
an 69550
officer 152757
in 153164
Ellsworth's 155620
company 163966
and 1002
was 29077
familiar 1152
with 44664
fancy 881
manoeuvres 1197
for 1431
street 1483
parade 17974
and 18305
with 18311
a 18374
special 18397
skirmish 18414
drill 18417
and 18439
bayonet 18479
exercise 18560
Small 18591
swarthy 18599
with 18681
angular 19040
features 19130
and 19183
a 19233
brusque 20126
military 20192
manner 21171
in 21614
a 25189
showy 25993
uniform 26110
and 29399
jaunty 29777
kepi 30132
of 30148
scarlet 30229
cloth 30354
covered 31183
with 32446
gold 32763
lace 33492
he 33507
created 34745
quite 36745
a 36846
sensation 37168
among 37290
us 37318
His 38280
assumption 38884
of 39799
knowledge 39829
and 40777
experience 42063
was 42379
accepted 42418
as 44709
true 44946
He 45124
claimed 45144
to 45293
have 45394
been 45745
a 46194
surgeon 46711
in 47044
the 47558
French 47586
army 47845
in 48339
Algiers 48448
though 48628
we 48682
afterward 49136
learned 49394
to 50328
doubt 50584
if 51223
his 53195
rank 54057
had 54724
been 65737
higher 65789
than 66618
that 66747
of 67883
a 68253
barber-surgeon 68311
of 68751
a 68963
cavalry 69040
troop 69108
From 69773
the 69914
testimonials 70645
he 70939
brought 71026
with 71081
him 71104
I 71696
thought 71845
I 72188
was 73482
doing 73857
a 74086
good 74283
thing 74654
in 75401
making 75422
him 82843
my 83277
brigade-major 83902
as 85348
the 87369
officer 91116
was 91231
then 92736
called 92874
whom 92904
we 93105
afterward 93116
knew 93119
as 93166
inspector-general 93582
He 93700
certainly 93716
was 94314
a 95346
most 95669
indefatigable 95890
fellow 95993
and 96788
went 97524
at 98176
his 98249
work 98589
with 98736
an 99015
enthusiasm 99107
that 99704
made 99766
him 99869
very 99903
useful 102551
for 127654
a 127750
time 128279
It 129933
was 131536
worth 137826
something 137987
to 138143
see 138191
a 140810
man 142336
who 181648
worked 181988
with 1029
a 29104
kind 963
of 21798
dash 1735
--with 88624
a 1133
prompt 37087
staccato 1113
movement 1731
that 37067
infused 88620
spirit 175478
and 17962
energy 70707
into 90245
all 150169
around 163149
him 164241
He 164261
would 173260
drill 68871
all 1246
day 2426
and 3574
then 3935
spend 4001
half 4102
the 4262
night 4829
trying 5392
to 5826
catch 5835
sentinels 6688
and 7028
officers 7131
of 16348
the 28364
guard 30739
at 35871
fault 36157
in 50476
their 53089
duty 53138
My 53285
first 53685
impression 53702
was 53770
that 54352
I 54783
had 54832
got 54966
hold 55174
of 55209
a 55251
most 55516
valuable 55574
man 56210
and 56354
others 62841
were 66914
so 67753
much 70479
of 75637
the 75747
same 75903
mind 77235
that 77731
in 78206
the 79487
reorganization 83637
of 83930
regiments 85774
he 85940
was 86803
successively 87544
elected 88132
major 93683
of 98960
the 112548
Eighth 119437
and 119517
then 119749
colonel 119823
of 120001
the 120009
Eleventh 120129
We 120601
shall 122028
see 122118
more 122356
of 122504
him 122705
as 122879
we 123003
go 123224
on 123303
but 124111
it 124823
turned 125267
out 125575
that 125608
his 125937
sharp 127470
discipline 127511
was 128092
not 131110
steady 134056
or 134161
just 139709
his 139927
knowledge 141716
was 143000
only 143137
skin-deep 143157
and 143170
he 143234
had 143362
neither 143540
the 143543
education 144184
nor 145075
the 145110
character 145127
for 145567
so 145592
responsible 145786
a 145854
situation 146828
as 147379
he 149931
was 150084
placed 152916
in 153383
He 153646
nearly 153770
plagued 153927
the 153956
life 153990
out 153997
of 154114
the 154245
officers 154368
of 154502
his 154608
regiment 154712
before 156391
they 156534
got 156572
rid 157021
of 157174
him 158169
and 158514
was 159395
a 159449
most 162684
brilliant 172562
example 174643
of 175196
the 175281
way 178587
we 178619
were 179443
imposed 179807
upon 180223
by 30006
military 31092
charlatans 55434
at 83432
the 83435
beginning 145875
He 146076
was 146237
however 173245
good 133667
proof 143286
also 107334
of 107962
the 110766
speed 111275
with 111899
which 92128
real 79684
service 39286
weeds 149974
out 162405
the 166
undesirable 281
material 4351
which 5205
seemed 5367
so 5748
splendid 6860
in 10064
the 10257
days 10287
of 10319
common 12332
inexperience 13987
and 14697
at 15231
a 15255
distance 15709
from 22864
danger 23353
We 25309
had 27501
visits 28073
from 28244
clerical 28736
adventurers 28939
too 28983
for 30367
the 30917
pay 31404
and 32440
emoluments 34932
of 34989
a 37186
captain 38447
of 39547
cavalry 40507
which 41562
the 43657
law 47080
gave 49129
to 52497
a 54060
chaplain 54341
induced 56409
some 59394
to 64606
seek 67182
the 69113
office 69154
who 69222
were 69283
not 69926
the 70078
best 72112
representatives 76342
of 82936
their 83205
profession 85539
One 88738
young 93032
man 94525
who 102497
had 103062
spent 111605
a 112109
morning 117334
soliciting 124785
the 128558
appointment 128658
in 131158
one 133653
of 133852
the 134099
regiments 137486
came 139163
to 140179
me 142303
in 142464
a 144964
shamefaced 147754
sort 147786
of 147957
way 148113
before 148538
leaving 148907
camp 149035
and 150368
said 150482
General 151061
before 153424
I 182207
decide 11874
this 22355
matter 68709
I 143817
wish 144842
you 153608
would 174846
tell 121398
me 184329
just 184326
what 184550
are 184360
the 184561
pay 541
and 184378
emoluments 98062
of 115046
a 115103
Captain 63673
of 13015
Calvary 21465
Though 21523
most 62587
of 62713
our 63666
men 64283
were 64332
native 65209
Ohioans 62635
General 17367
Bates's 1470
brigade 65776
had 68316
in 71144
it 71208
two 71373
regiments 71396
made 71824
up 71903
of 72128
quite 50418
contrasted 85704
nationalities 124323
The 124416
Ninth 124421
Ohio 158699
was 161700
recruited 162329
from 164569
the 174180
Germans 175700
of 17694
Cincinnati 89568
and 118661
was 118693
commanded 125589
by 160646
Colonel 160658
Bob 17067
McCook 17145
In 17834
camp 18052
the 19165
drilling 20163
of 21693
the 39943
regiment 53552
fell 53683
almost 53819
completely 58921
into 60069
the 62861
hands 62942
of 64627
the 66481
adjutant 68714
Lieutenant 70283
Willich 83591
afterward 85670
a 93156
general 93215
of 96002
division 96516
and 97149
McCook 97276
who 97697
humorously 97943
exaggerated 98454
his 98502
own 99651
lack 101807
of 102902
military 107764
knowledge 108768
used 108790
to 112021
say 113938
that 116538
he 116769
was 118754
only 124225
clerk 126067
for 132983
a 140252
thousand 146650
Dutchmen 149314
so 154275
completely 160669
did 162102
the 163199
care 166119
of 169091
equipping 169291
and 169676
providing 173466
for 175775
his 176031
regiment 150504
engross 111777
his 24531
time 17225
and 108614
labor 183093
The 25019
Tenth 25646
was 166934
an 167403
Irish 167461
regiment 167432
and 159889
its 71922
men 180752
used 172994
to 35084
be 35547
proud 36729
of 43721
calling 75511
themselves 76552
the 131596
Bloody 93847
Tinth 1472
The 1718
brilliant 4137
Lytle 15929
was 17925
its 17991
commander 28417
and 29178
his 29414
control 29448
over 29481
them 29651
even 30026
in 30063
the 30125
beginning 30430
of 31757
their 32195
service 32450
and 33979
near 36392
the 40208
city 43822
of 43962
their 44047
home 44739
showed 45120
that 45358
they 45384
had 45483
fallen 46169
into 47650
competent 47812
hands 48144
It 48248
happened 48441
of 48677
course 48771
that 49477
the 49883
guard-house 50523
pretty 60060
frequently 61894
contained 62120
representatives 62125
of 65778
the 66223
Tenth 68274
who 68318
on 69555
the 69641
short 69888
furloughs 71039
that 71053
were 71146
allowed 71826
them 71905
took 72130
a 74028
parting 74226
glass 74292
too 78139
much 78705
with 78980
their 79311
friends 80044
in 88607
the 90277
city 90284
and 90553
came 91292
to 91435
camp 108281
boisterously 115284
drunk 120630
But 122031
the 131664
men 139391
of 144803
the 149296
regiment 149655
got 178179
it 68823
into 50507
their 70931
heads 71655
that 72288
the 185044
Thirteenth 167009
which 3063
lay 169569
just 973
opposite 21808
them 12176
across 18942
the 73979
railroad 92723
took 96110
a 67925
malicious 67964
pleasure 24609
in 122061
filling 178570
the 178664
guard-house 145207
with 26310
the 134969
Irishmen 135406
Some 135408
threats 1707
had 1806
been 1982
made 3074
that 3095
they 3155
would 12253
go 14974
over 76734
and 77370
clean 88365
out 88518
the 88596
Thirteenth 88824
and 89223
one 90135
fine 91062
evening 94370
these 94949
came 96355
to 98422
a 98883
head 99574
I 100314
suddenly 101010
got 102660
orders 103175
from 103289
General 103335
Bates 109444
to 111321
form 111345
my 111485
brigade 112736
and 112985
march 117110
them 117195
at 117276
once 117447
between 117484
the 117504
Tenth 117628
and 117718
Thirteenth 126651
to 127302
prevent 128547
a 128825
collision 128940
which 130529
seemed 131146
imminent 133684
My 133784
brigade 133917
was 150199
selected 150280
because 150469
it 151071
was 153589
the 157634
one 158193
to 158567
which 158691
neither 159042
of 159187
the 162838
angry 163068
regiments 163639
belonged 163738
the 168568
others 168578
being 169270
ordered 169580
into 169601
their 170101
quarters 170197
My 171060
little 171438
Frenchman 172480
De 172576
Villiers 173066
covered 175890
himself 176380
with 176665
glory 176962
His 177172
horse 177306
flew 179053
under 179230
the 179297
spur 180131
to 181051
the 181244
regimental 182464
headquarters 631
the 1511
long 2693
roll 3874
was 6263
beaten 8266
as 11156
if 17118
the 19839
drummers 28197
realized 60335
the 65152
full 67653
importance 73803
of 75132
the 75822
first 75901
opportunity 83575
to 83706
sound 84884
that 86402
warlike 91794
signal 102792
and 112424
the 112512
brigade-major's 117705
somewhat 121391
theatrical 121420
energy 128305
was 128756
so 134004
contagious 140660
that 144670
many 144909
of 147742
the 150773
companies 151702
were 151742
assembled 152267
and 152336
ready 152446
to 153182
file 153341
out 153578
of 154068
the 154591
company 154618
streets 156284
before 157240
the 160496
order 161186
reached 165271
them 167229
We 170345
marched 172641
by 173656
the 177961
moonlight 2786
into 152820
the 155475
space 156765
between 59050
the 169288
belligerent 65194
regiments 130562
but 38973
Lytle 3959
had 4296
already 4902
got 31699
his 51435
own 88835
men 89169
under 95357
control 95463
and 122926
the 126643
less 130554
mercurial 153105
Thirteenth 168988
were 169053
not 174706
disposed 175758
to 185003
be 3785
aggressive 4661
so 66922
that 70300
we 89444
were 118690
soon 151990
dismissed 153054
with 153072
a 166351
compliment 175267
for 80131
our 18462
promptness 20542
I 143801
ordered 56542
the 62516
colonels 113905
to 115189
march 129312
the 148361
regiments 171531
back 19703
to 29888
the 70848
camps 90774
separately 98770
and 101832
with 130082
my 173348
staff 45929
rode 89569
through 118662
that 125590
of 145558
the 93
Thirteenth 2219
to 31296
see 44723
how 47394
matters 47533
were 50569
there 54879
All 98594
was 118908
quiet 120677
the 125933
men 125957
being 129899
in 136371
their 138687
quarters 138889
so 139037
turning 139439
I 163957
passed 177857
along 181276
near 182090
the 23817
railway 64278
in 124352
rear 151474
of 152600
the 175553
quartermaster's 182022
sheds 510
In 66024
the 86472
shadow 87612
of 87774
the 103019
buildings 123038
I 126684
had 127059
nearly 130237
ridden 130346
over 161566
some 165025
one 101
on 108
foot 143
when 712
he 2233
addressed 2604
me 3060
and 3279
I 3287
recognized 112236
an 121394
officer 126087
of 128933
high 147653
rank 151745
in 160568
that 169566
brigade 182083
He 182526
was 182533
in 184268
great 184333
agitation 184337
and 184379
exclaimed 184382
Oh 184388
General 184553
what 184565
a 2606
horrible 147655
thing 151747
that 151749
brothers 181728
should 126687
be 1833
killing 1979
each 104786
other 111342
I 182774
assured 184335
him 184371
the 184390
danger 184557
of 184567
that 184551
was 711
all 3286
over 184352
and 20505
rode 20594
on 20734
wondering 20838
a 149623
little 706
at 42006
his 42131
presence 42182
in 42487
that 43788
place 43844
under 44014
the 51502
circumstances 112773
The 121311
six 121401
weeks 122513
of 123244
our 124942
stay 125657
in 125720
Camp 125917
Dennison 129854
seem 131128
like 133443
months 134357
in 134527
the 134816
retrospect 136031
so 136138
full 136933
were 137119
they 138930
crowded 142591
with 161359
new 161627
experiences 181000
The 181323
change 181641
came 181651
in 18718
an 18880
unexpected 48156
way 56051
The 58179
initiative 58365
taken 62847
by 69332
the 70618
Confederates 72416
in 78296
West 82415
Virginia 85052
had 101275
to 105437
be 108653
met 137429
by 144880
prompt 146673
action 164327
and 176362
McClellan 179570
was 183163
forced 75189
to 12889
drop 483
his 12521
own 15936
plans 16489
to 16836
meet 17220
the 17490
emergency 17746
The 18146
organization 18505
and 18983
equipment 19435
of 19848
the 19979
regiments 20456
for 20855
the 21032
three 22171
years' 22438
service 22853
were 23236
still 23437
incomplete 24719
and 24964
the 25298
brigades 26481
were 26783
broken 28458
up 28805
to 31408
take 31949
across 32736
the 33176
Ohio 33327
the 33531
regiments 34034
best 34307
prepared 34809
to 34939
go 35549
One 36691
by 37130
one 37359
my 37688
regiments 38289
were 39743
ordered 39853
away 40121
till 40759
finally 40871
when 41349
on 42079
the 43739
3d 43746
of 43919
July 46129
I 47724
received 48572
orders 49371
to 49638
proceed 49848
to 50553
the 50837
Kanawha 56535
valley 59486
I 59805
had 65882
but 66590
one 66980
of 67457
the 67746
four 67949
regiments 68368
to 69173
which 69296
I 69656
had 70660
been 71322
trying 71581
to 71915
give 72225
something 72575
of 73213
unity 74397
and 74830
brigade 75404
feeling 75886
and 75975
that 76107
regiment 76387
the 76465
Eleventh 76770
Ohio 77082
was 77546
still 77648
incomplete 78041
General 78209
Bates 78349
fared 78755
even 79004
worse 79285
for 79501
he 79517
saw 79704
all 80071
his 80290
regiments 80354
ordered 80616
away 80758
whilst 81215
he 82209
was 82283
left 83147
to 83290
organize 83912
new 84266
ones 84674
from 85019
freshly 85358
recruited 85509
companies 85880
that 86023
were 86463
sent 86568
to 86986
the 87021
camp 87340
This 87965
was 87995
discouraging 88519
to 88726
a 90082
brigade 92488
commander 92852
for 93407
even 93652
with 95511
veteran 96417
troops 96420
mutual 96573
acquaintance 97232
between 97709
the 98763
officer 99387
and 100197
his 100306
command 102626
is 103154
a 103598
necessary 104080
condition 104245
of 105356
confidence 105414
and 105739
a 106256
most 106584
important 106777
element 107199
of 107390
strength 107853
My 108091
own 108434
assignment 108923
to 109142
the 109447
Great 109762
Kanawha 110662
district 110775
was 110861
one 111128
I 111598
had 111695
every 112310
reason 112821
to 113083
be 113315
content 113633
with 114003
except 114178
that 114577
for 114877
several 115131
months 115693
I 116274
felt 116543
the 116797
disadvantage 117127
I 117920
suffered 121378
from 124480
assuming 124932
command 125110
of 125336
troops 125672
which 126377
I 126852
had 127145
never 127597
seen 128146
till 128715
we 129084
met 129645
in 131322
the 131465
field 132679
The 133383
period 133564
of 134291
organization 134547
brief 135382
as 135547
it 135893
was 135957
had 136268
been 136576
valuable 136884
to 137343
the 137643
regiments 137893
and 138313
it 138503
had 138919
been 139561
of 140850
the 141082
utmost 141283
importance 141599
to 142562
secure 142634
the 146154
re-enlistment 147637
of 148236
those 152454
which 152578
had 154541
received 154707
some 156407
instruction 156947
It 157746
had 158438
been 158717
in 159093
the 159385
condition 159742
of 159871
the 160402
statute 160558
law 160633
from 161179
necessity 161835
and 162107
not 162545
from 162957
choice 164378
that 164588
the 165123
Administration 165252
had 165489
called 166068
out 166272
the 166926
state 167488
militia 167709
for 168346
ninety 168668
days 168809
The 169113
new 169539
term 169549
of 170218
enrolment 170655
was 171030
for 171485
three 171607
years 171878
or 172195
the 172660
war 172912
and 173274
the 173444
forces 173558
were 173906
now 174227
designated 174667
as 174966
United 175184
States 175760
Volunteers 176328
It 176540
would 176818
have 177553
been 177811
well 177837
if 177921
the 178725
period 179472
of 179593
apprenticeship 180296
could 180568
have 180910
been 181360
prolonged 181504
but 15460
events 60387
would 60390
not 122360
wait 410
All 715
recognized 1019
the 2638
necessity 2983
and 3032
thankful 3290
as 3368
we 4173
should 4337
have 4349
been 5553
for 5754
a 5859
longer 6171
preparation 6695
and 6827
more 9336
thorough 9563
instruction 9929
we 11519
were 11767
eager 11891
to 12012
be 12106
ordered 12154
away 12502
McClellan 12713
had 13958
been 14339

a 14975
major-general 15582
in 15641
the 15906
regular 16337
army 16360
and 16404
a 16438
department 16545
had 16595
been 16668
placed 16698
under 16753
his 16762

which 17659
included 17842
the 17847

Ohio 18669

a 33014
brigadier-general 33039
in 33090
the 33114
regulars 33263
and 33521
there 33591
was 34626
much 34916
debate 34996
at 35303
the 35476
time 35484
whether 36387
the 36489
Administration 36721
had 36858
intended 37629
this 38609
Many 38681
insisted 45835
that 48018
he 48658
was 49700
nominated 50713
for 51172
the 51201
volunteer 51265
service 51401
and 54965
that 60539
the 66795
regular 68190
appointment 68382
was 68505
a 69229
clerical 69320
mistake 69336
in 69366
the 69387
bureaus 69503
at 69527
Washington 69586
There 69606
was 69617
no 69703
solid 69800
foundation 69816
for 71245
this 71288
gossip 71526
A 71540
considerable 72038
increase 72514
of 72842
the 74339
regular 76320
army 76330
was 76642
authorized 76674
by 76677

and 76730
corresponding 77036
appointments 77043
were 77407
made 77437
from 77557
major-general 77563
downward 77591
It 77624
was 77661
at 77943
this 78117
time 78689
that 78819
Sherman 78854
was 79110
made 79297
colonel 79439
of 83447
one 83469
of 85699
the 90607
new 91620

It 95173
would 95201
perhaps 95545
have 95564
been 95750
wiser 95790
to 95895
treat 96713
the 100677
regular 108080
commissions 108846
as 115019
prizes 115686
to 118950
be 119415
won 120598
only 124419
by 131578
conspicuous 131592
and 131882
successful 132138
service 132399
in 132577
the 132648
field 132934
as 133223
was 133256
done 133268
later 133369
but 133515
this 133556
policy 133642
was 133761
not 134238
then 134269
adopted 134605
and 134783
the 135402
newly 135494
created 135524
offices 136258
were 136546
filled 136569
in 137245
all 137361
grades 137364
They 139031
were 139294
of 139415
course 140523
given 140560
to 140568
men 142347
from 143006
whom 145042
great 145226
services 145335
could 146982
reasonably 147687
be 148230
expected 148268
but 148345
when 148405
none 148584
had 148838
been 148883
tested 149034
in 149847
the 150246
great 152874
operations 152905
of 153168
war 154046
every 154212
appointment 157097
was 157394
at 157729
the 158108
risk 158748
that 159059
the 159536
officer 159639
might 162972
not 162997
show 163378
the 163427
special 164965
talent 165345
for 165511
command 165555
which 165701
makes 165850
a 166385
general 166656
It 166748
was 166786
something 167236
of 167261

country 145009
and 145332
ending 145436
with 145480
his 145629
congratulations 146029
to 146041
his 146161
troops 146351
in 146417
which 146618
he 147320
announced 147597
that 147827
they 148049
had 148171
annihilated 148341
two 148784
armies 148865
commanded 149047
by 149097
educated 149133
and 149198
experienced 149213
soldiers 149328
intrenched 149512
in 149594
mountain 149639
fastnesses 149797
fortified 150074
at 150419
their 150462
leisure 151258
The 151413
country 151434
was 151546
eager 151553
for 151600
good 151703
news 151732
and 151751
took 151890
it 152063
as 152168
literally 152297
true 152312
McClellan 153496
was 153630
the 153783
hero 153869
of 153892
the 153964
moment 153984
and 154010
when 154165
but 154225
a 154321
week 154371
later 154731
his 154780
success 155158
was 155177
followed 155216
by 155701
the 155729
disaster 155848
to 156629
McDowell 156667
at 156710
Bull 156770
Run 156803
he 156876
seemed 156976
pointed 157755
out 157884
by 158112
Providence 158158
as 158207
the 158249
ideal 158315
chieftain 159010
who 159037
could 159649
repair 159827
the 159852
misfortune 160087
and 160156
lead 160409
our 160459
armies 160498
to 160595
certain 160645
victory 160657
His 161009
personal 161078
intercourse 161267
with 161330
those 161370
about 161417
him 161465
was 161631
so 161860
kindly 161927
and 161963
his 162096
bearing 162138
so 162552
modest 163072
that 163124
his 163144
dispatches 163274
proclamations 163451
and 163472
correspondence 163827
are 163884
a 164385
psychological 164425
study 164785
more 165019
puzzling 165108
to 165155
those 165176
who 165242
knew 165358
him 165453
well 165975
than 165995
to 166150
strangers 166341
Their 166570
turgid 166721
rhetoric 166836
and 167072
exaggerated 167495
pretence 167822
did 167937
not 168080
seem 168110
natural 168143
to 168166
him 168187
In 168507
them 169176
he 169435
seemed 169817
to 169939
be 169964
composing 169982
for 170044
stage 170122
effect 170225
something 170485
to 171216
be 171807
spoken 171978
in 172026
character 172042
by 172202
a 172261
quite 172288
different 172440
person 172667
from 172725
the 172767
sensible 172849
and 172868
genial 173116
man 174305
we 174404
knew 174436
in 174511
daily 174745
life 174806
and 174848
conversation 175382
The 175476
career 175586
of 175744
the 175820
great 176066
Napoleon 176335
had 176379
been 176950
the 177088
study 177659
and 177791
the 177874
absorbing 178105
admiration 178220
of 178245
young 178426
American 178870
soldiers 179052
and 179306
it 179545
was 179672
perhaps 180130
not 180383
strange 180735
that 180858
when 180989
real 181083
war 181175
came 181248
they 181432
should 181456
copy 181712
his 181849
bulletins 181874
and 181892
even 181900
his 181928
personal 182125
bearing 182323
It 182335
was 182378
for 182416
the 183071
moment 183240
the 183312
bent 183342
of 183895
the 184451
people 184631
to 184899
be 184931
pleased 184975
with 185126
McClellan's 21414
rendering 25560
of 25578
the 28125
role 28192
they 36321
dubbed 42644
him 49275
the 63403
young 64900
Napoleon 78995
and 81523
the 82638
photographers 129855
got 137211
him 137302
to 137682
stand 139820
with 141022
folded 141456
arms 159866
in 162278
the 163544
historic 163575
pose 175400
For 175520
two 5418
or 13109
three 60843
weeks 83393
his 91797
dispatches 102805
and 151131
letters 163987
were 142320
all 39228
on 60919
fire 3586
with 4557
enthusiastic 4572
energy 4805
He 4963
appeared 6272
to 6331
be 7161
in 7343
a 7691
morbid 8850
condition 9697
of 12581
mental 13521
exaltation 14019
When 15988
he 21627
came 22663
out 27421
of 30046
it 32228
he 33681
was 42338
as 42712
genial 46952
as 50881
ever 51602
The 53666
assumed 56922
dash 57319
and 57678
energy 62354
of 62436
his 62664
first 62896
campaign 62912
made 62980
the 63174
disappointment 66729
and 72926
the 74953
reaction 83781
more 84016
painful 86774
when 89836
the 91365
excessive 91907
caution 93659
of 94169
his 94827
conduct 95671
in 97406
command 98379
of 102345
the 105178
Army 106734
of 106802
the 111308
Potomac 120891
was 122906
seen 123260
But 130807
the 132085
Rich 134801
Mountain 136038
affair 140722
when 142382
analyzed 143497
shows 143774
the 144322
same 144614
characteristics 145666
which 149282
became 149355
well 150507
known 150740
later 150873
There 151488
was 151531
the 154196
same 155463
over-estimate 158987
of 162825
the 163487
enemy 166386
the 169077
same 172957
tendency 173391
to 173490
interpret 173565
unfavorably 176911
the 181268
sights 181664
and 183004
sounds 183033
in 91775
front 16536
the 18024
same 20101
hesitancy 20290
to 21074
throw 27743
in 29806
his 30493
whole 32476
force 48079
when 51807
he 54417
knew 62944
that 66657
his 70982
subordinate 71209
was 72856
engaged 77553
If 84897
Garnett 85462
had 93268
been 93280
as 104175
strong 111806
as 113869
McClellan 113956
believed 115467
him 129200
he 130107
had 138258
abundant 143660
time 145277
and 146607
means 157471
to 157716
overwhelm 158531
Morris 162391
who 166101
lay 166796
four 167026
days 169703
in 171780
easy 174674
striking 175480
distance 176087
while 178776
the 181381
National 8877
commander 8910
delayed 12049
attacking 12220
Pegram 14465
and 16079
had 24316
Morris 24826
been 25692
beaten 28034
Garnett 28149
would 35401
have 36662
been 40731
as 46736
near 48904
Clarksburg 53926
as 55972
his 55992
opponent 57464
and 58272
there 58280
would 58614
have 60627
been 62243
a 62692
race 67244
for 67266
the 68456
railroad 72314
But 72869
happily 73039
Garnett 74937
was 75043
less 75093
strong 75284
and 75713
less 76812
enterprising 76886
than 77566
he 78124
was 82026
credited 84419
with 84531
being 84630
Pegram 89670
was 91030
dislodged 92049
and 93297
the 94391
Confederates 94420
made 96755

on 95462
the 107646
2d 108280
of 135417
July 69799
the 71525
rumors 76673
he 77562
heard 95200
of 95575
Garnett's 95836
strength 96103
and 75242
the 163016

the 72035

of 76725
General 69821

force 131577
in 142819
the 51200
Great 69605

made 76690
him 77556
conclude 92516
to 95563
order 95598
a 95838
brigade 96116
to 16
that 78

for 5460
the 6472

the 15676
lower 17163
part 20491
of 21015
the 21884
valley 24922
defensively 26854
till 28009
he 29572
might 29675
try 31291
to 32379
cut 32701
off 34314
Wise's 39075
army 44085
after 46296
Garnett 49191
should 50673
be 50722
disposed 54491
of 55286
This 56498
duty 59107
was 59437
assigned 60243
to 60830
me 60867
On 61202
the 61869
22d 62220
of 63319
June 66580
I 66627
had 67043

Volunteers 72387
superseding 74482
my 76165
state 79210
commission 79391
I 80684
had 80782
seen 82443
the 82696

of 84312
my 84486
brigade 87703
going 88780
one 90862

one 92291
as 93348
fast 94087

they 98673
were 99217
reorganized 99275
for 101345
the 101422
three 102530
years' 102672

I 105363
had 105776

follow 112301
them 112336

The 120183

the 15007
spice 143363
of 143541
possible 76146
danger 125146
to 125348
make 173326
this 104029
our 105009
first 105962
day 106035
in 106084
an 124508
enemy's 1031
country 1044
key 1107
everybody 18124
to 21837
just 23106
such 23110
a 23380
pitch 23397
as 24103
apparently 24325
to 25181
double 26369
the 26935
vividness 27049
of 28549
every 28769
sensation 29106
The 29119
landscape 31066
seemed 31352
more 31415
beautiful 31651
the 32549
sunshine 32613
more 32670
bright 33480
and 33715
the 34763
exhilaration 34817
of 35123
out-door 35431
life 35435
more 35459
joyous 35502
than 35542
any 35672
we 36724
had 37061
ever 37804
known 39824
The 39871
halt 39965
for 40030
the 40042
night 40058
had 41132
been 41187
assigned 41235
at 52934
a 53556
little 53871
village 137513
on 21876
the 24226
right 25141
northern 25995
bank 26594
of 26770
the 27138
stream 33650
which 35448
was 35556
nestled 39911
beneath 40002
a 41075
ridge 41161
which 43880
ran 53978
down 91239
from 95833
the 95873
hills 95923
toward 95959
the 96053
river 97396
making 97730
an 100470
excellent 3706
position 22334
for 31598
defence 33899
against 56593
any 60135
force 63818
which 64942
might 65170
come 73140
against 84401
it 94454
from 96641
the 115977
upper 117235
valley 119497
The 126592
sun 146097
was 146481
getting 158329
low 159749
behind 180303
us 54615
in 86937
the 151666
west 33865
as 47180
we 130427
approached 141409
it 158375
and 33098
the 72222
advance-guard 57963
had 165394
already 166250
halted 172838
Captain 173173
Cotter's 181336
two 181367
bronze 181389
guns 181284
gleamed 175442
bright 63057
on 100772
the 103748
top 104203
of 105081
the 105145
ridge 105215
beyond 105471
the 105560
pretty 105653
little 105765
town 105804
and 106054
before 106185
the 106282
sun 106477
went 106656
down 107165
the 107217
new 107323
white 107374
tents 107590
had 107711
been 107738
carried 107833
up 107971
to 108192
the 108328
slope 108363
and 108374
pitched 108559
there 108677
The 109189
steamers 109208
were 109570
moored 109716
to 109789
the 109811
shore 109941
and 110022
the 110286
low 110467
slanting 110572
rays 110613
of 110689
the 110773
sunset 111220
fell 111280
upon 111935
as 112484
charming 112684
a 122563
picture 159888
as 1878
was 104831
ever 1905
painted 104858
An 1921
outpost 104874
with 1862
pickets 104815
was 25643
set 111881
on 7029
the 7132
southern 43268
side 11495
of 11633
the 807
river 9865
both 126578
grand 78976
and 133376
camp 133390
guards 134203
were 134429
put 134744
out 135356
also 135609
on 135639
the 136458
side 136555
we 136858
occupied 137261
and 138620
the 138886
men 139042
soon 139076
had 139501
their 144853
supper 148428
and 152507
went 157441
to 157899
rest 157945
Late 2703
in 55465
the 133448
evening 147752
a 148488
panic-stricken 2376
countryman 131060
came 72529
in 72593
with 73037
the 23022
news 50070
that 50311
General 68592
Wise 71191
was 71359
moving 71505
down 71999
upon 72084
us 72154
with 72370
men 72853
The 73034
man 73099
was 1401
evidently 65707
in 1485
earnest 73777
and 1561
was 80932
a 1699
loyal 88588
one 1779
He 99547
believed 2286
every 130970
word 1829
he 104782
said 1975
but 111338
he 2115
had 118804
in 2230
fact 126084
seen 2433
only 140349
a 2596
few 147645
of 2706
the 152740
enemy's 2827
horsemen 157498
who 2930
were 163325
scouting 3057
toward 169563
us 3134
and 175869
believed 38668
their 11875
statement 182772
that 184321
an 184324
army 184345
was 184364
at 184376
their 60696
back 58727
It 141257
was 92454
our 173094
initiation 62140
into 61152
an 4985
experience 28222
of 54576
rumors 56016
that 57495
was 62729
to 66520
continue 91156
as 91324
long 103605
as 114413
the 118131
war 124288
We 125549
were 128426
to 130240
get 148076
them 154548
daily 156483
and 161690
almost 179915
hourly 15930
sometimes 28418
with 31758
a 60061
little 61895
foundation 62121
of 62126
fact 80045
sometimes 90554
with 91293
none 115285
rarely 120631
purposely 122032
deceptive 144804
but 149297
always 149656
grossly 32073
exaggerated 78459
making 84651
chimeras 126460
with 34
which 29475
a 64268
commanding 87929
officer 126784
had 152633
to 170257
wage 170284
a 182466
more 182714
incessant 183206
warfare 183414
than 183692
with 183843
the 183864
substantial 183981
enemy 184020
in 184055
his 184096
front 184649
I 124964
reasoned 126606
that 126795
Wise's 127291
troops 182496
were 175299
like 14433
my 14457
own 61890
too 184
raw 274
to 460
venture 535
a 596
night 608
attack 624
with 841
and 1180
contented 1315
myself 1332
with 1346
sending 1396
a 1663
strong 2186
reconnoitring 2461
party 2525
out 2689
beyond 2699
my 2852
pickets 2966
putting 3384
in 3419
command 3459
of 3495
it 3512
Major 3557
Hines 3588
of 3598
the 3601
Twelfth 3632
Ohio 3640
an 3689
officer 3728
who 3735
subsequently 3755
became 3791
noted 3800
for 3885
his 3891
enterprise 4014
and 4106
activity 4143
in 4290
charge 4404
of 4486
scouting 4526
parties 4541
The 4569
camp 4660
rested 4744
quietly 4793
and 4859
toward 4881
morning 4992
Hines 5057
returned 5117
reporting 5284
that 5334
a 5473
troop 5509
of 5518
the 5595
enemy's 5605
horse 5623
had 5732
come 5883
within 5914
a 5919
couple 5931
of 5944
miles 6019
of 6077
our 6156
position 6242
in 6303
search 6309
of 6420
information 6431
about 6474
us 6517
and 6560
our 6620
movement 6685
They 6790
had 6802
indulged 6865
in 6883
loud 6923
bragging 6959
as 7025
to 7043
what 7057
Wise 7112
and 7140
his 7191
army 7215
would 7276
do 7450
with 7479
us 7493
but 7501
this 7514
and 7518
nothing 7557
more 7573
was 7602
the 7626
basis 7738
of 7748
our 7757
honest 7878
friend's 7926
fright 7958
The 8026
morning 8036
dawned 8048
bright 8083
and 8091
peaceful 8097
the 8118
steamers 8139
were 8254
sent 8305
back 8325
for 8362
a 8366
regiment 8435
which 8557
was 8573
still 8597
at 8618
Point 8675
Pleasant 8699
and 8736
the 8956
day 8981
was 9153
used 9187
in 9193
concentrating 9236
the 9240
little 9258
army 9309
and 9423
preparing 9442
for 9452
another 9501
advance 9532
On 9595
July 9699
13th 9721
we 9727
moved 9733
again 9759
making 9793
about 9899
ten 9934
miles 9999
and 10016
finding 10040
the 10242
navigation 10252
becoming 10262
difficult 10293
by 10298
reason 10344
of 10381
the 10444
low 10453
water 10474
At 10494
several 10611
shoals 10674
in 10687
the 10706
stream 10722
rough 10733
wing-dams 10745
had 10748
been 10860
built 10871
from 10882
the 10969
sides 11071
to 11132
concentrate 11297
the 11387
water 11449
in 11489
the 11496
channel 11546
and 11605
at 11628
Knob 11676
Shoals 11686
in 11726
one 11772
of 11820
these 11852
chutes 11865
as 11942
they 12024
were 12036
called 12047
a 12070
coal 12076
barge 12118
had 12134
sometime 12185
before 12275
been 12396
sunk 12404
In 12489
trying 12511
to 12545
pass 12633
it 12662
our 12703
leading 12773
boat 12796
grounded 12955
and 13068
the 13083
current 13104
being 13134
swift 13244
it 13294
was 13396
for 13442
a 13445
time 13452
doubtful 13473
if 13582
we 13672
should 13719
get 13724
her 13732
off 13746
We 13759
finally 13775
succeeded 13804
however 13854
and 13964
the 14000
procession 14127
of 14184
boats 14212
slowly 14222
steamed 14297
up 14318
the 14350
rapids 14378
We 14399
had 14420
hardly 14462
got 14472
beyond 14482
them 14506
when 14519
we 14524
heard 14540
a 14559
distant 14582
cannon-shot 14585
from 14600
our 14623
advance-guard 14641
which 14649
had 14654
opened 14659
a 14707
long 14780
distance 14807
between 14854
them 14871
and 14880
us 14903
during 14917
our 14947
delay 15009
We 15033
steamed 15129
rapidly 15169
ahead 15201
Soon 15226
we 15366
saw 15463
a 15487
man 15680
pulling 15697
off 15703
from 15868
the 15886
south 15893
bank 15914
in 15945
a 15980
skiff 16125
Nearing 16131
the 16143
steamer 16170
he 16317
stood 16361
up 16368
and 16440
excitedly 16549
shouted 16824
that 16870
a 16928
general 17021
engagement 17041
had 17073
begun 17080
We 17165
laughingly 17180
told 17226
him 17662
it 17690
couldn't 17722
be 17729
very 17872
general 17900
till 18071
we 18234
got 18370
in 18403
and 18515
we 18551
moved 18651
on 18729
keeping 18747
a 18907
sharp 19083
outlook 19087
for 19141
our 19241
parties 19267
on 19276
either 19303
bank 19339
When 19364
we 19401
came 19462
up 19524
to 19539
them 19549
we 19599
learned 19608
that 19621
a 19723
party 19776
of 19786
horsemen 19958
had 20041
appeared 20046
on 20187
the 20227
southern 20331
side 20349
of 20378
the 20387
river 20418
and 20549
had 20556
opened 20612
a 20687
skirmishing 20773
fire 20971
but 20978
had 20996
scampered 21120
off 21182
as 21189
if 21245
the 21341
Old 21400
Nick 21443
were 21559
after 21718
them 21745
when 21839
a 21852
shell 21995
from 22000
the 22026
rifled 22132
gun 22199
was 22239
sent 22419
over 22473
their 22527
heads 22547
The 22708
shell 22715
like 22736
a 22763
good 22788
many 22870
that 22973
were 22994
made 23033
in 23088
those 23178
days 23187
did 23207
not 23255
explode 23258
and 23360
the 23455
simple 23505
people 23622
of 23626
the 23648
vicinity 23714
who 23820
had 23833
heard 23881
its 23924
long-continued 23939
scream 24045
told 24093
our 24119
men 24135
some 24186
days 24205
after 24211
that 24236
they 24245
thought 24291
it 24300
was 24358
going 24437
yet 24462
From 24494
this 24503
time 24520
some 24529
show 24541
of 24564
resistance 24582
was 24598
made 24614
by 24628
the 24708
enemy 24782
and 24788
the 24841
skirmishing 24875
somewhat 24933
retarded 25010
the 25039
movement 25190
Still 25221
about 25362
ten 25409
miles 25556
was 25696
made 25715
each 25779
day 25812
till 25940
the 25975
evening 26069
of 26162
the 26185
16th 26252
when 26379
we 26394
encamped 26432
at 26458
the 26463
mouth 26497
of 26750
the 26839
Pocotaligo 26907

The 27980
evening 28117
before 28172
we 28351
had 28513
had 28533
one 28599
of 28622
those 28677
incidents 28725
not 28757
unusual 28793
with 28828
new 28842
troops 28901
which 28932
prove 28944
that 28967
nothing 28993
but 29023
habit 29156
can 29188
make 29196
men 29212
cool 29223
and 29236
confident 29240
in 29256
their 29269
duties 29417
We 29423
had 29467
as 29494
usual 29513
moored 29550
our 29721

A 30732

of 30879
the 30903

small 32218

marching 32355

the 32576

up 32658
the 32697

after 32860
landing 32894
when 32910
suddenly 32926
a 32956
shot 32966
was 33469
heard 33525
and 33564
then 33573
an 33602
irregular 33612
volley 33615
was 33653
both 33762
seen 33902
and 33923
heard 33935
as 33968
the 34010
muskets 34132
flashed 34175
out 34316
in 34369
the 34379

A 34434
supporting 34466

quickly 34583
sent 34594
over 34655

no 34690
further 34695
disturbance 34819
occurring 34823
a 34850
search 34984
was 35023
made 35062
for 35079
an 35214
enemy 35385
but 35407
none 35423
was 35533

A 35596

accidentally 35804
gone 35829
off 35884

bewildered 36617

why 36835
nor 36892
at 36934

Two 37120

was 38229
a 38393
lesson 38468
to 38476
the 38516
whole 38536
command 38551
The 38689
soldiers 38716
were 38742
brave 38789
enough 38820
and 38829
were 38920
thoroughly 38938
ashamed 38946
of 39088
themselves 39124

short 74091

become 74758
discouraged 74795

given 74956
it 74958
up 74978

men 75206
killed 75236

wounded 75320
If 75481
they 75723
had 75838
held 75880

asked 76082

assistance 76256
it 76262
would 76358
have 76482
been 76504
well 76511
enough 76743
but 76796
as 76839
was 76846
common 76927
with 77153
new 77159

they 77173
passed 77269
from 77288
confidence 77320
to 77333
discouragement 77441
as 77454
soon 77459

they 77713
retreated 77754

bank 81390
of 81418
the 81433
river 81619
till 81738
they 81836
came 81851
opposite 81940
the 81958
enemy's 81970
position 82018
the 82049
hostile 82060
party 82246
on 82360
our 82396
side 82494
of 82557
the 82741
stream 82812
having 82867
fallen 82876
back 82897
beyond 82932
this 82992
point 82998
They 83312
were 83337
told 83367
by 83448
a 83496
negro 83535
that 83601
the 83621
rebels 83644
were 83764
in 83817
retreat 83981
and 84018
they 84088
got 84126
the 84214
black 84227
man 84337
to 84467
ferry 84541
them 84549
over 84600
in 84691
a 84718
skiff 84760
that 84808
they 84820
might 84836
be 85094
the 85099
first 85107
to 85117
congratulate 85184
their 85220
friends 85275
To 85356
their 85473
amazement 85762
they 85781
were 85980
welcomed 86013
as 86140
prisoners 86163
by 86218
the 86237
Confederates 86363
who 86371
greatly 86377
enjoyed 86413
their 86418
discomfiture 86872
The 86894
negro 86912
had 87003
told 87285
the 87308
truth 87407
in 87419
saying 87463
that 87485
the 87516
enemy 87521
had 87574
been 87606
in 87657
retreat 87787
for 87808
the 88078
fact 88195
was 88221
that 88371
both 88392
sides 88694
retreated 88748
but 88807
the 88852
Confederates 88908
being 88945
first 89001
informed 89022
of 89067
this 89129
resumed 89174
their 89314
position 89328
and 89351
claimed 89450
a 89472
victory 89492
The 89509
officers 89518
who 89561
were 89585
captured 89702
had 89771
gone 89775
out 89793
without 89801
permission 89805
and 89838
led 89979
on 90160
by 90192
the 90308
hare-brained 90389
De 90430
Villiers 90434
had 90448
done 90483
what 90730
they 90770
knew 90801
was 90820
foolish 90865
and 90897
unmilitary 90932
resulting 90947
for 90978
them 90985
in 91045
a 91065
severe 91102
experience 91160
in 91188
Libby 91213
Prison 91219
at 91227
Richmond 91387
and 91408
for 91411
us 91417
in 91487
the 91515
momentary 91542
appearance 91565
of 91567
lack 91570
of 91600
discipline 91614
and 91630
order 91635
which 91668
could 91679
not 91696
fairly 91743
be 91746
charged 91752
upon 91766
the 91834
command 91848
I 91866
reported 91892
the 92003
facts 92083
without 92097
disguise 92123
or 92171
apology 92187
trusting 92196
to 92230
the 92250
future 92263
to 92342
remove 92355
the 92413
bad 92419
impression 92449
the 92520
affair 92713
must 92915
naturally 92919
make 92926
upon 92964
McClellan 92967
The 93008
report 93011
of 93054
the 93172
strength 93191
of 93203
the 93337
position 93442
attacked 93680
and 93750
our 93821
knowledge 93935
of 93946
the 93951
increasing 94074
difficulty 94100
of 94226
the 94275
ground 94279
before 94307
us 94324
led 94385
me 94395
to 94397
conclude 94407
that 94425
the 94514
wisest 94585
course 94590
would 94610
be 94641
to 94669
await 94909
the 94963
arrival 95053
of 95121
the 95211
wagons 95219
now 95277
daily 95302
expected 95319
and 95329
then 95411
with 95438
supplies 95569
for 95604
several 95655
days 95659
in 95688
hand 95782
move 95808
independent 96010
of 96014
the 96028
steamers 96139
which 96142
became 96255
only 96302
an 96393
embarrassment 96401
when 96534
it 96842
was 96862
advisable 96890
to 96909
leave 96930
the 96967
river 96973
road 96996
for 97051
the 97057
purpose 97357
of 97386
turning 97408
a 97569
fortified 97760
position 97798
like 97823
that 97828
we 97858
had 97901
found 97920
before 98274
us 98291
We 98320
therefore 98349
rested 98516
quietly 98526
in 98679
our 98806
strong 98896
camp 98899
for 98965
several 99050
days 99225
holding 99228
both 99315
banks 99467
of 99485
the 99636
river 99645
and 99688
preparing 99706
to 99729
move 99745
the 99939
main 99964
column 100003
by 100007
a 100063
country 100074
road 100135
leading 100153
away 100231
from 100303
the 100422
stream 100446
on 100476
the 100616
north 100690
side 100763
and 100811
returning 100822
to 100848
it 100863
at 100904
Tyler 100932
Mountain 100937
where 101046
Wise's 101071
camp 101107
was 101120
reported 101172
to 101196
be 101229
I 101254
ordered 101390
up 101396
the 101416
First 101425
Kentucky 101445
from 101794
Ravenswood 101860
and 101938
Ripley 101965
but 102061
its 102159
colonel 102405
found 102449
obstacles 102456
in 102465
his 102538
way 102621
and 102676
did 102773
not 102784
join 102865
us 102874
till 102894
we 102919
reached 102972
Charleston 103049
the 103206
following 103269
week 103321
On 103636
the 103639
23d 103832
of 103881
July 103953
I 104066
had 104113
succeeded 104197
in 104208
getting 104240
wagons 104281
and 104439
teams 104595
enough 104650
to 104992
supply 105050
the 105087
most 105096
necessary 105131
uses 105139
and 105161
renewed 105299
the 105309
advance 105497
We 105543
marched 105623
rapidly 105670
on 105720
the 105926
24th 105974
by 106016
the 106024
circuitous 106048
route 106189
I 106218
have 106242
mentioned 106359
leaving 106406
a 106575
regiment 106665
to 106736
protect 106804
the 106888
steamboats 106914
The 107079
country 107117
was 107256
very 107454
broken 107481
and 107553
the 107674
roads 107714
very 107787
rough 107802
but 107934
the 107947
enemy 107954
had 107957
no 108025
knowledge 108063
of 108072
our 108283
movement 108299
and 108456
toward 108469
evening 108634
we 108990
again 109350
approached 109361
the 109485
river 109490
immediately 109744
in 109882
rear 109950
of 110028
their 110245
camp 110449
at 110473
Tyler 110646
Mountain 110675
When 110946
we 110964
drove 111000
in 111026
their 111076
pickets 111084
the 111224
force 111531
was 111615
panic-stricken 111761
and 111770
ran 111774
off 111786
leaving 111967
their 112044
camp 112181
in 112253
confusion 112397
and 112492
their 112728
supper 112758
which 112871
they 112883
were 112891
cooking 112900
but 112918
did 113167
not 113286
stop 113452
to 113592
eat 113629
A 113690
little 113712
below 113723
the 113818
point 113833
where 113839
we 113863
reached 113944
the 114025
river 114139
and 114143
on 114226
the 114236
other 114254
side 114322
was 114368
the 114401
steamboat 114441
Maffet 114843
with 114908
a 115002
party 115005
of 115058
soldiers 115235
gathering 115326
the 115343
wheat 115384
which 115519
had 115543
been 115571
cut 115945
in 115952
the 115963
neighboring 115971
fields 116038
and 116380
was 116420
in 116496
the 116601
sheaf 116819
I 116914
was 117051
for 117087
a 117186
moment 117271
doubtful 117354
whether 117443
it 117707
might 117776
not 117816
be 117831
one 117835
of 117852
our 117880
own 117973
boats 118134
which 118235
had 118336
ventured 118398
up 118529
the 118556
river 118587
under 118593
protection 118875
of 119002
the 119011
regiment 119111
left 119169
behind 119182
and 119323
directed 119329
our 119391
skirmishers 119431
who 119663
were 119691
deployed 119711
along 119739
the 119920
edge 120033
of 120054
the 120073
water 120178
to 120222
hail 120235
the 120277
other 120309
side 120432
Who 120477
are 120517
you 120521
was 120532
shouted 120614
from 120633
both 120642
banks 120652
simultaneously 120877
United 120952

Hurrah 121979
for 122006
Jeff 122112
Davis 122148
shouted 122174
the 122240
others 122283
and 122306
a 122343
rattling 122350
fire 122431
opened 122466
on 122470
both 122481
sides 122535
A 123032
shell 123112
was 123136
sent 123187
from 123341
our 123352
cannon 123390
into 123426
the 123467
steamer 123552
and 123556
the 123622
party 123695
upon 123772
her 123783
were 123806
immediately 123856
seen 123866
jumping 123899
ashore 123979
having 124007
first 124045
set 124079
fire 124088
to 124119
her 124133
to 124159
prevent 124237
her 124404
falling 124428
into 124453
our 124610
hands 124807
The 124888
enemy 124922
then 125166
moved 125200
away 125270
on 125306
that 125377
side 125426
under 125521
cover 125582
of 125593
the 125786
trees 125965
which 126025
lined 126233
the 126300
river 126440
bank 126506
Night 126570
was 126580
now 126782
falling 126809
and 127003
sending 127027
forward 127071
an 127127
advance-guard 127182
to 127248
follow 127276
up 127677
the 127718
force 127728
whose 128341
camp 128359
we 128761
had 128781
surprised 128807
we 128845
bivouacked 128884
on 128958
the 128991
mountain 129228
side 129349
In 129448
the 129458
morning 129531
as 129814
we 129991
were 130058
moving 130071
out 130092
at 130102
an 130130
early 130142
hour 130162
we 130191
were 130231
met 130268
by 130287
the 130298
mayor 130301
and 130397
two 130411
or 130416
three 130438
prominent 130452
citizens 130457
of 130488
Charleston 130511
who 130522
came 130561
to 130564
surrender 130592
the 130631
town 130637
to 130642
us 130682
Wise 130693
having 130708
hurriedly 130725
retreated 130902
during 130925
the 130953
night 130962
He 131228
had 131282
done 131304
a 131382
very 131436
unnecessary 131453
piece 131501
of 131667
mischief 131809
before 131847
leaving 131894
in 132155

cutting 132429
off 132514
the 132517

a 132717
fine 132766

to 134697
him 134889
that 134957
it 134960
would 134996
delay 135001
our 135043

by 140441

with 140642
Gallipolis 140726
and 140741
by 140754
wagons 140786
with 140791
such 140955
positions 140963
as 141005
we 141068
might 141112
occupy 141254
further 141334
up 141389
the 141401
river 141420
Deputations 141437
of 141555
the 141574
townspeople 141719
were 142194
informed 142218
that 142295
it 142379
was 142432
not 142487
our 142515
policy 142529
to 142559
meddle 142605
with 142613
private 142649
persons 142653
who 142687
remained 142697
quietly 142703
at 142851
home 142881
nor 143007
would 143024
we 143085
make 143160
any 143188
inquisition 143206
as 143263
to 143269
the 143281
personal 143290
opinions 143352
of 143372
those 143457
who 143525
attended 143646
strictly 143670
to 143970
their 143996
own 144029
business 144112
but 144144
they 144151
were 144201
warned 144223
that 144246
any 144270
communication 144387
with 144411
the 144526
enemy 144570
would 144617
be 144807
remorselessly 144865
punished 144884
We 144889
were 144912
now 145020
able 145034
to 145114
get 145192
more 145286
accurate 145311
information 145322
about 145367
Wise's 145409
forces 145444
than 145681
we 145799
could 145850
obtain 145864
before 145868
and 145891
this 145922
accorded 145954
pretty 145985
well 146025
with 146131
the 146211
strength 146220
which 146332
he 146466
reported 146486
officially 146493
Footnote 146497
Ante 146556
p 146563
note 146655
His 146682
infantry 146695
was 146877
therefore 146886
more 146900
than 146908
equal 146928
to 146935
the 146950
column 146958
under 147065
my 147068
command 147174
in 147176
the 147186
valley 147193
whilst 147230
in 147244
artillery 147272
and 147280
in 147333
cavalry 147367
he 147443
was 147585
greatly 147608
superior 147616
Our 147738
continued 147748
advance 147771
in 147812
the 147867
face 147891
of 147971
such 147975
opposition 148041
is 148065
sufficient 148110
evidence 148141
that 148180
the 148215
Confederate 148245
force 148248
was 148379
not 148665
well 148698
handled 148777
for 148792
as 148813
the 148920
valley 148938
contracted 149063
and 149143
the 149157
hills 149171
crowded 149192
in 149207
closer 149248
to 149274
the 149342
river 149462
nearly 149524
every 149637
mile 149649
offered 149681
positions 149752
in 149755
which 149777
small 149896
numbers 149905
could 149921
hold 149952
at 150042
bay 150057
an 150146
army 150213
Our 150293
success 150303
in 150316
reaching 150337
Charleston 150380
was 150405
therefore 150512
good 150520
ground 150661
for 150753
being 150777
content 150794
with 150822
our 150828
progress 150845
though 150855
I 150885
had 150921
to 150928
blame 150938
myself 150950
for 151109
errors 151407
in 151429
the 151437
management 151469
of 151494
my 151523
part 151605
of 151709
the 151915
campaign 152132
at 152137
Pocataligo 152187
I 152196
ought 152220
not 152284
to 152308
have 152322
assumed 152329
as 152521
confidently 152540
as 152586
I 152647
did 152733
that 152881
the 152919
enemy 153018
was 153071
only 153085
five 153133
hundred 153160
strong 153196
at 153227
Scary 153297
Creek 153327
and 153416
that 153481
a 153596
detachment 153604
could 153941
dispose 154169
of 154348
that 154365
obstacle 154388
whilst 154405
the 154412
rest 154466
of 154550
the 154605
column 154723
prepared 154748
to 154878
advance 154963
on 154995
our 155032
principal 155039
line 155075
Wise's 155088
force 155125
at 155156
that 155183
point 155300
was 155313
in 155322
fact 155487
double 155529
the 155615
number 155679
supposed 155684

It 156238
is 156309
true 156426
it 156649
was 156662
very 156719
inconvenient 156778
to 156807
ferry 156813
any 156820
considerable 156879
body 156893
of 156998

back 157227
and 157247
forth 157404
across 157480
the 157523
river 157603
but 157615
I 157663
should 157703
nevertheless 157710
have 157779
taken 157810
the 157836
bulk 157859
of 158056
my 158071
command 158083
to 158094
the 158100
left 158131
bank 158218
and 158263
by 158312
occupying 158342
the 158348
enemy's 158407
attention 158423
at 158460
the 158473
mouth 158480
of 158522
Scary 158572
Creek 158620
covered 158668
the 158681
movement 158795
of 158806
a 158828
sufficient 158904
force 159233
upon 159336
his 159343
flank 159669
by 159708
means 159815
of 159823
the 159839
fords 159919
farther 159936
up 159998
that 160071
stream 160084
This 160262
would 160298
have 160345
resulted 160380
in 160554
the 160673
complete 160740
routing 160909
of 160917
the 160921
detachment 160977
and 161081
it 161144
is 161193
nearly 161213
certain 161240
that 161373
I 161409
could 161470
have 161643
pushed 161737
on 161759
to 161849
Charleston 161876
at 161957
once 161975
and 161982
could 161995
have 162052
waited 162130
there 162141
for 162205
the 162292
organization 162324
of 162344
my 162347
wagon 162518
train 162573
with 162579
the 162675
prestige 162702
of 163234
victory 163289
instead 163361
of 163476
doing 163489
so 163505
at 163530
'Poca' 163630
with 163648
the 163682
appearance 163796
of 163854
a 163862
check 163881
McClellan 163918
recognized 163937
the 163941
fact 164056
that 164103
he 164115
was 164217
asking 164227
me 164329
to 164338
face 164354
the 164359
enemy 164476
with 164488
no 164559
odds 164598
in 164601
my 164607
favor 164613
and 164623
as 164673
soon 164714
as 164717
he 164729
heard 164746
that 164997
Wise 165043
was 165070
disposed 165079
to 165112
make 165136
a 165222
stand 165410
he 165584
directed 165592
me 165603
not 165621
to 165685
risk 165704
attacking 165812
him 165845
in 165875
front 165921
but 166104
rather 166189
to 166199
await 166209
the 166230
result 166323
of 166337
his 166392
own 166414

Rosecrans 167466
did 167539
the 167550
same 167585
when 167627
he 167683
assumed 167686
command 167852
but 167872
I 167962
knew 167979
the 168047
hope 168090
had 168101
been 168194
that 168253
I 168258
would 168309
reach 168357
Gauley 168379
Bridge 168472
and 168480
I 168622
was 168638
vexed 168806
that 168842
my 168856
movement 168972
should 169000
have 169149
the 169252
appearance 169298
of 169303
failing 169314
when 169475
I 169484
was 169688
conscious 169724
that 169759
we 169771
had 169839
not 169852
fairly 169858
measured 169930
our 169991
strength 170006
with 170467
my 170494
opponent 170644
As 170699
soon 170773
therefore 170785
as 170836
the 170878
needful 170910
preparations 170980
could 171019
be 171071
made 171264
I 171319
decided 171804
upon 171843
the 171944
turning 172069
movement 172076
which 172173
I 172209
have 172212
already 172264
described 172298
and 172417
our 172423
resolute 172427
advance 172435
seems 172487
to 172502
have 172534
thrown 172541
Wise 172605
into 172629
a 172635
panic 172682
from 172824
which 172896
he 172967
did 172978
not 173318
recover 173373
till 173633
he 173861
got 173938
far 173957
beyond 174021
Gauley 174114
Bridge 174149
At 174254
Charleston 174281
I 174423
learned 174451
of 174657
the 174740
Bull 174772
Run 174777
disaster 175250
and 175273
that 175322
McClellan 175395
had 175559
been 175652
ordered 175788
to 175797
Washington 175823
leaving 176009
Rosecrans 176030
in 176046
command 176144
of 176176
our 176234
department 176254
The 176279
latter 176342
sent 176419
me 176506
orders 176517
which 176559
implied 176575
that 176630
to 176715
reach 176813
Charleston 176829
was 176873
the 177030
most 177118
he 177144
could 177151
expect 177235
of 177258
me 177342
and 177346
directing 177532
me 177542
to 177621
remain 177872
on 178040
the 178078
defensive 178183
if 178194
I 178232
should 178265
succeed 178270
in 178284
getting 178384
so 178423
far 178430
whilst 178459
he 178510
should 178582
take 178697
up 178751
anew 178767
McClellan's 178906
plan 178985
of 178992
reaching 179006
the 179190
rear 179406
of 179434
Wise's 179482
army 179508
Footnote 179615
Dispatches 179657
of 179896
July 179911
and 179987
His 180164
dispatches 180220
fortunately 180323
did 180327
not 180367
reach 180376
me 180419
till 180497
I 180631
was 180666
close 180698
to 181008
Gauley 181018
Bridge 181033
and 181137
was 181184
sure 181271
of 181280
my 181312
ability 181343
to 181350
take 181385
possession 181402
of 181742
that 181777
defile 181794
some 181863
forty 181898
miles 181912
above 181934
Charleston 182007
An 182249
additional 182332
reason 182352
for 182425
my 182615
prompt 182677
advance 182918
was 182922
that 182928
the 182950
Twenty-first 182973
Ohio 183006
was 183035
not 183082
yet 183135
re-enlisted 183266
for 183366
the 183459
war 183499
was 183634
only 183727
a 183732
three 183771
months 183773
regiment 183777
whose 183780
time 183784
was 183819
about 183846
to 183866
expire 183983
and 183991
Governor 184024
Dennison 184037
had 184062
telegraphed 184070
me 184073
to 184077
send 184118
it 184122
back 184234
to 184241
Ohio 184249
I 184300
left 184395
this 184409
regiment 184422
as 184439
a 184466
post-garrison 184472
at 184493
Charleston 184504
till 184516
it 184722
could 184848
be 184906
relieved 185155
by 185290
another 185332
or 185356
till 185385
my 43897
success 48257
in 50868
reaching 114529
Gauley 170933
Bridge 175830
should 177058
enable 178057
me 180115
to 180275
send 180577
back 19768
a 23424
detachment 69043
for 98403
that 99678
post 132606
and 136807
on 138189
the 165270
26th 168116
July 175838
pushed 177000
forward 180189
with 2322
the 131006
rest 3204
of 68960
my 131853
column 171990
which 175939
now 28795
that 31385
the 177237
First 178089
Kentucky 178356
had 3212
joined 175947
me 57864
consisted 91812
of 18536
four 509
regiments 1656
Our 81027
first 85895
night's 152383
encampment 28124
was 182889
about 39409
eleven 42972
miles 150301
above 180869
Charleston 6032
in 27164
a 57483
lovely 59699
nook 60617
between 66908
spurs 75218
of 81613
the 83560
hills 83585
Here 123591
I 123752
was 123972
treated 125746
to 129388
a 137148
little 166348
surprise 173544
on 180308
the 140144
part 6167
of 20731
three 26587
of 28634
my 32793
subordinates 33622
which 35702
was 36853
an 38116
unexpected 39752
enlargement 39802
of 41442
my 47507
military 53455
experience 55677
The 58577
camp 63023
had 64077
got 70401
nicely 71894
arranged 71927
for 72849
the 74618
night 77021
and 77364
supper 79355
was 79643
over 83107
when 83508
these 86905
gentlemen 97415
waited 98816
upon 110593
me 115590
at 116511
my 116576
tent 116635
The 117094
one 125154
who 125740
had 133689
shown 136104
the 136854
least 142878
capacity 156793
as 157297
commander 157806
of 158511
a 160041
regiment 163190
was 163667
spokesman 164909
and 167458
informed 172082
me 174059
that 177440
after 178912
consultation 178957
they 179878
had 54386
concluded 119495
that 141722
it 65550
was 141698
foolhardy 2472
to 140388
follow 147221
the 119074
Confederates 119552
into 120667
the 2684
gorge 5096
we 5786
were 7051
travelling 8253
and 9211
that 9483
unless 9939
I 10550
could 11842
show 11931
them 13418
satisfactory 16820
reasons 16879
for 16901
changing 18326
their 18492
opinion 18879
they 18882
would 19064
not 19118
lead 19177
their 19336
commands 19501
further 20138
into 20327
it 20401
I 20596
dryly 20642
asked 20673
if 21383
he 23451
was 24311
quite 24388
sure 24686
he 25123
understood 25208
the 25386
nature 26593
of 27204
his 27285
communication 27462
There 29549
was 30157
something 32107
probably 32637
in 33166
the 33750
tone 34184
of 37352
my 37368
question 39320
which 39521
was 40232
not 40371
altogether 40415
expected 44010
and 44068
his 47655
companions 47859
began 54772
to 55271
look 56961
a 60685
little 64192
uneasy 64362
He 68672
then 70433
protested 70944
that 73023
none 73515
of 74239
them 75028
meant 75331
any 75596
disrespect 75998
but 77409
that 78673
as 79225
their 79811
military 80473
experience 80806
was 81099
about 81372
as 81802
extensive 85456
as 88025
my 88917
own 90070
they 90251
thought 90779
I 93086
ought 93190
to 93209
make 94405
no 94860
movements 95227
but 95691
on 95958
consultation 95991
with 96878
them 96952
and 97040
by 99443
their 99531
consent 100597
The 101045
others 101388
seemed 101450
to 103519
be 103635
better 103691
pleased 104112
with 105268
this 105375
way 106868
of 107109
putting 108129
it 108226
and 108836
signified 109985
assent 110569
My 110649
answer 110860
was 111174
that 111252
their 111639
conduct 112574
very 112611
plainly 113076
showed 113202
their 114746
own 115021
lack 115532
both 117676
of 120334
military 120460
experience 120491
and 122034
elementary 122213
military 122387
knowledge 123264
and 127158
that 127212
this 129784
ignorance 130448
was 130503
the 130608
only 131409
thing 131506
which 131687
could 132244
palliate 132266
their 132701
action 133470
Whether 134278
they 137757
meant 138821
it 138898
or 139012
not 139054
their 139534
action 140707
was 146420
mutinous 147733
The 150878
responsibility 152317
for 152353
the 156665
movement 157683
of 159045
the 159772
army 159983
was 160961
with 160997
me 161699
and 162133
whilst 162404
I 163047
should 163651
be 163991
inclined 164300
to 164533
confer 165669
very 166297
freely 166604
with 167241
my 167327
principal 168074
subordinates 168172
and 168180
explain 168454
my 168494
purposes 168661
I 168688
should 171895
call 171960
no 172000
councils 173114
of 173488
war 174037
and 174801
submit 174985
nothing 175696
to 176229
vote 176448
till 176468
I 178763
felt 181056
incompetent 181122
to 181219
decide 181474
for 182264
myself 183972
If 184751
they 184862
apologized 184892
for 185054
their 185427
conduct 185459
and 4767
showed 10402
earnestness 11632
in 22071
military 22216
obedience 23078
to 23461
orders 25109
what 25211
they 27174
had 27288
now 29995
said 30045
would 30329
be 30473
overlooked 32243
but 33356
on 35816
any 36659
recurrence 37764
of 42241
cause 42692
for 43316
complaint 44770
I 44990
should 46439
enforce 46549
my 46579
power 46678
by 47658
the 48897
arrest 51220
of 57931
the 59660
offender 61126
at 66049
once 66237
I 76478
dismissed 76910
them 79850
with 80187
this 91206
and 91381
immediately 93247
sent 95042
out 95068
the 98407
formal 101157
orders 101419
through 102762
my 103054
adjutant-general 105333
to 108054
march 112604
early 114045
next 114166
morning 114810
Before 114901
they 115008
slept 115441
one 116291
of 118367
the 121077
three 125613
had 129223
come 129885
to 136848
me 139537
with 151921
earnest 154714
apology 159987
for 166632
his 168343
part 168691
in 169448
the 174873
matter 178167
and 178721
a 60673
short 65414
time 91649
made 392
them 11483
all 44025
as 77734
subordinate 37462
as 8740
I 12245
could 50152
wish 52465
The 84052
incident 87859
could 102075
not 110374
have 129599
occurred 135891
in 136124
the 146787
brigade 153206
which 163684
had 169234
been 172477
under 175542
my 177521
command 181744
at 52658
Camp 55029
Dennison 102608
and 168787
was 181927
a 181865
not 53394
unnatural 50529
result 54086
of 61005
the 85239
sudden 109279
assembling 120058
of 125248
inexperienced 147099
men 152989
under 165597
a 172506
brigade 63500
commander 113472
of 119165
whom 169649
they 21472
knew 77785
nothing 170087
except 10799
that 17734
at 141608
the 156611
beginning 87454
of 52995
the 22185
war 83711
he 88049
was 147240
a 174735
civilian 65652
like 88210
themselves 172539
These 21676
very 28785
men 41785
afterward 42657
became 63514
devoted 83798
followers 115767
and 116367
some 141888
of 147154
them 475
life-long 59701
friends 61079
It 62973
was 114117
part 129901
of 162004
their 74105
military 75869
education 152661
as 74220
well 34438
as 60200
mine 60776
If 61044
I 61245
had 677
been 8832
noisy 9350
and 9451
blustering 122273
in 127217
my 129676
intercourse 134031
with 169382
them 169416
at 182870
the 7549
beginning 144287
and 148809
had 7342
done 9434
what 119741
seemed 5784
to 6187
be 6832
regarded 14551
as 17445
the 30731
regulation 82250
amount 84420
of 85562
cursing 102138
and 112672
swearing 113239
they 115584
would 118518
probably 118547
have 118726
given 119873
me 123794
credit 123956
for 124724
military 125643
aptitude 125936
at 130920
least 135646
but 149163
a 153368
systematic 155761
adherence 161991
to 175074
a 185247
quiet 185288
and 70111
undemonstrative 185228
manner 182926
evidently 183060
told 183178
against 183352
me 183497
at 183681
first 183721
in 183822
their 183854
opinion 184047
Through 183389
my 122628
army 185101
life 54230
I 55660
met 84049
more 98808
or 101916
less 2387
of 131071
the 84824
same 22432
conduct 24889
when 142009
assigned 176437
to 8532
a 7097
new 14367
command 20311
but 23500
when 25431
men 25625
learned 41574
that 47319
discipline 52356
would 76714
be 82597
inevitably 88159
enforced 92932
and 94377
that 116302
it 130283
was 130519
as 134045
necessary 137796
to 137956
obey 138157
a 139685
quiet 146080
order 148606
as 170514
one 173298
emphasized 174662
by 181090
expletives 6225
and 7082
especially 9119
when 22190
they 27967
had 51941
been 72944
a 76532
little 109664
under 116578
fire 122531
there 98988
was 84575
no 40912
more 50229
trouble 60622
Indeed 123403
I 124822
was 141711
impressed 153315
with 171855
the 177316
fact 28282
that 29838
after 46503
this 53368
acquaintance 67844
was 67872
once 74379
made 82122
my 124399
chief 126476
embarrassment 133868
in 147080
discipline 150005
was 153438
that 165729
an 165795
intimation 178324
of 57396
dissatisfaction 86397
on 178565
my 158154
part 4684
would 112969
cause 113450
deeper 116189
chagrin 120937
and 162221
more 11267
evident 19907
pain 50726
than 63639
I 75883
intended 88783
or 152466
wished 154480
The 167405
same 178444
march 184058
enabled 184676
me 26603
to 77073
make 77537
the 80703
acquaintance 81778
of 100169
another 107446
army 145511
institution 151019
--the 160487
newspaper 76122
correspondent 87099
We 102939
were 114858
joined 115837
at 144392
Charleston 154164
by 165107
two 167814
men 119282
representing 181937
influential 25534
Eastern 32097
journals 46137
who 51090
wished 52952
to 58225
know 85318
on 90640
what 92153
terms 108771
they 117855
could 118357
accompany 124384
the 143331
column 146914
The 149136
answer 152665
was 170555
that 175335
the 175539
quartermaster 58038
would 112635
furnish 115991
them 347
with 13496
a 150903
tent 150973
and 7438
transportation 130827
and 6268
that 46352
their 58030
letters 134682
should 32909
be 37972
submitted 71690
to 71943
one 131849
of 452
the 660
staff 52223
to 70004
protect 96745
us 112339
from 113366
the 145470
publication 159239
of 3153
facts 26591
which 39480
might 81131
aid 82262
the 85405
enemy 92487
This 116068
seemed 136958
unsatisfactory 160400
and 175888
they 176109
intimated 18603
that 58358
they 128857
expected 172317
to 172323
be 90894
taken 128739
into 142714
my 154429
mess 28445
and 55617
to 87179
be 156608
announced 81346
as 89763
volunteer 102173
aides 164763
with 98746
military 10533
rank 41664
They 126404
were 13041
told 118643
that 118674
military 145805
position 157968
or 177804
rank 154177
could 119915
only 130588
be 111706
given 9650
by 9840
authority 15689
much 27899
higher 27938
than 38935
mine 39567
and 47313
that 53624
they 83340
could 89037
be 120466
more 140180
honestly 145037
independent 38502
if 94003
free 38344
from 11272
personal 54423
obligation 66861
and 131329
from 52691
temptation 87212
to 139898
repay 61257
favors 62392
with 65173
flattery 70182
My 74939
only 90931
purpose 152307
was 65328
to 134446
put 91307
the 36453
matter 51524
upon 51596
the 1519
foundation 10870
of 15165
public 15580
right 16672
and 17893
of 18027
mutual 22251
self-respect 23699
The 23721
day 24822
before 24993
we 26805
reached 30164
Gauley 30633
Bridge 36710
they 37432
opened 37721
the 43961
subject 45064
again 46747
to 48439
Captain 49476
McElroy 49882
my 56204
adjutant-general 62702
but 66811
were 67033
informed 72587
that 73812
I 76456
had 77637
decided 90022
it 90197
upon 92327
a 92436
principle 95638
by 97641
which 97742
I 97783
meant 101467
to 105118
abide 105209
Their 106118
reply 106276
was 106880
Very 109864
well 114316
General 114445
Cox 114494
thinks 115548
he 116352
can 132192
get 132270
along 132300
without 132321
us 132357
and 132468
we 132502
will 132545
show 138675
him 147797
We 165045
will 168852
write 180407
him 11880
down 16385
They 16623
left 17525
the 36465
camp 45524
the 46007
same 46091
evening 52336
and 65049
wrote 85588
letters 87098
to 129575
their 150733
papers 153405
describing 154820
the 155116
army 155936
as 156163
demoralized 156197
drunken 156692
and 169819
without 176199
discipline 176371
in 178070
a 862
state 16222
of 101869
insubordination 110514
and 127629
the 146240
commander 151345
as 154477
totally 170946
incompetent 174573
As 3522
to 3831
the 38661
troops 54875
more 55120

leader 93101
of 94840
the 94980
good 95778
people 95896
at 96213
Chillicothe 97991
in 98064
providing 98498
a 98689
supper 99260
for 99277
the 99754
Eleventh 100259
Ohio 101514
as 103222
we 103422
were 106718
on 108276
our 108461
way 108502
from 109470
Camp 111942
Dennison 112357
to 115865
Gallipolis 116925
He 117848
had 118294
burned 118455
to 118974
have 119688
some 119718
part 120260
in 120659
the 122047
country's 122918
struggle 125034
and 127412
became 127495
a 128985
model 129573
chaplain 131883
till 132218
his 132229
labors 132419
and 133559
exposure 133953
broke 134117
his 134887
health 135887
and 136508
forced 137586
him 138050
to 141204
resign 142665
The 142894
presence 143550
of 143645
two 144819
such 145542
men 148275
gave 148441
some 148479
hours 150474
of 152363
refined 152444
social 156415
life 158557
in 158612
the 159311
intervals 160649
of 160895
rough 162283
work 165269
One 166098
evening 166642
walk 168246
along 168699
the 169206
Kanawha 170150
has 172145
ever 172734
since 172770
remained 172840
in 173816
my 174372
memory 174470
associated 176788
with 176862
Whittier's 179655
poem 180454
The 180536
River 181066
Path 181666
as 183250
a 184511
wilder 2357
and 131041
more 184732
brilliant 146689
type 181783
of 181875
the 69438
scene 3261
he 175996
pictured 180562
We 183801
had 10898
walked 110327
out 89779
beyond 175051
the 175867
camp 176284
leaving 177100
its 6150
noise 7176
and 9023
its 55532
warlike 55728
associations 56256
behind 61980
us 81128
for 112191
a 113328
turn 117080
of 126209
the 128950
road 129873
around 130316
a 146109
jutting 156143
cliff 165520
shut 172362
it 173077
all 177850
out 27434
as 39163
completely 63176
as 123544
if 7690
we 10977
had 11551
been 24198
transported 42663
to 52454
another 56885
land 57997
except 58935
that 59317
the 60710
distant 66336
figure 67722
of 73638
a 75330
sentinel 81919
on 84907
post 85115
reminded 86870
us 89179
of 94304
the 102208
limit 106887
of 115518
safe 121837
sauntering 123811
for 126410
pleasure 128402
My 130410
Presbyterian 137307
and 140336
Episcopalian 142062
friends 148300
forgot 150603
their 151209
differences 151378
of 151490
dogma 151559
and 152179
as 155016
the 156055
sun 5101
dropped 5243
behind 6624
the 54118
mountain 56501
tops 60940
making 64301
an 65452
early 82090
twilight 83004
in 87746
the 90953
valley 94535
we 117779
talked 117850
of 119763
home 121990
of 126486
patriotism 126603
of 126721
the 127076
relation 127106
of 128192
our 129005
struggle 129055
to 141382
the 151401
world's 152602
progress 157205
and 157268
other 157350
high 159410
themes 170186
when 181760
Sudden 182050
our 182197
pathway 182285
turned 182482
from 59870
night 25729
The 84990
hills 91858
swung 179836
open 59332
to 99047
the 162555
light 2907
Through 157578
their 122499
green 70304
gates 130899
the 52049
sunshine 52079
showed 52106
A 52150
long 52253
slant 80562
splendor 89366
downward 35061
flowed 141878
Down 39918
glade 56997
and 153726
glen 144333
and 144470
bank 144377
it 144488
rolled 144558
It 28927
bridged 25561
the 29606
shaded 32935
stream 41948
with 46623
gold 46842
And 47054
borne 48198
on 58032
piers 63627
of 67601
mist 71932
allied 72243
The 106580
shadowy 107001
with 111011
the 115839
sunlit 115898
side 115982
The 116042
surroundings 116565
the 174496
things 178212
of 2053
which 111416
we 156560
talked 3505
our 14268
own 14542
sentiments 17108
all 17945
combined 17996
to 21177
make 29247
the 30535
scene 31486
stir 31527
deep 32579
emotions 34427
for 35604
which 38722
the 38741
poet's 39288
succeeding 43510
lines 44586
seem 45808
the 45935
only 46734
fit 51635
expression 53757
and 54572
to 58377
link 58509
the 58605
poem 59621
indissolubly 65089
with 66944
the 68942
scene 70060
as 70523
if 75090
it 84460
had 84758
its 91887
birth 92367
there 93144
When 98374
Wise 98740
had 98937
retreated 99035
from 101696
the 105519
valley 108671
Colonel 117604
Tompkins 120472
had 122636
been 124719
unable 130424
to 139636
remove 141179
his 141278
family 145750
and 146701
had 152008
left 152013
a 159922
letter 162688
commending 163900
them 173817
to 175599
our 147083
courteous 27793
treatment 60603
Mrs 61351
Tompkins 64240
was 67700
a 123700
lady 138904
of 174157
refinement 180057
and 32635
her 43686
position 64494
within 138896
our 165089
outposts 143591
was 164290
far 83803
from 53426
being 141357
a 130744
comfortable 163670
one 164434
She 40146
however 44430
put 2386
a 31596
cheerful 40057
face 131070
upon 135222
her 142483
situation 2941
showed 163336
great 211
tact 391
in 1448
avoiding 3446
controversy 3565
with 3838
the 3842
soldiers 3966
and 4237
in 4593
conciliating 4700
the 5019
good-will 5501
of 6038
the 6376
officers 6566
and 6668
remained 6733
with 7101
her 7530
children 7577
and 9174
servants 9313
in 9746
her 9777
picturesque 9950
home 10324
on 10337
the 10427
mountain 10739
So 10845
long 10981
as 11084
there 11258
was 11699
no 11868
fighting 11919
in 12535
the 13040
near 13253
vicinity 13809
it 14017
was 14430
comparatively 14490
easy 14633
to 15056
save 15445
her 15525
from 16175
annoyance 16680
but 16809
when 17523
a 17717
little 18161
later 18249
in 18535
the 18713
autumn 19494
Floyd 21011
occupied 22101
Cotton 22140
Mountain 22184
and 22579
General 23633
Rosecrans 23873
was 23951
with 24151
us 24162
with 24264
larger 24773
forces 24847
such 24880
a 25029
household 25238
became 25924
an 26317
object 26344
of 26690
suspicion 27317
and 27910
ill-will 29152
which 29363
made 29661
it 29673
necessary 29694
to 30333
send 30385
her 30630
through 30937
the 31197
lines 31824
to 31990
her 32013
husband 32177
The 32288
men 32416
fancied 32486
they 32492
saw 32754
signals 33083
conveyed 33247
from 33286
the 33709
house 34233
to 34735
the 35060
enemy 35278
and 35725
believed 36115
that 37622
secret 37770
messages 38313
were 38410
sent 38982
giving 39164
information 39393
of 39641
our 39678
numbers 39782
and 40136
movements 40196
All 40257
this 40355
was 40636
highly 40962
improbable 41256
for 41813
the 42038
lady 42210
knew 42477
that 42589
her 42760
safety 42785
depended 43507
upon 43605
her 43808
good 44627
faith 44875
and 45860
prudence 46075
but 46217
such 47053
camp 47161
rumor 47379
becomes 47712
a 48170
power 48310
and 48348
Rosecrans 48371
found 48494
himself 48614
compelled 49647
to 50044
end 50117
it 51713
by 52048
sending 52088
her 52457
away 52842
He 53065
could 53234
no 53367
longer 53636
be 53651
answerable 53688
for 53785
her 53791
complete 53803
protection 54236
This 54567
however 54688
was 55011
not 55049
till 55077
November 55119
and 55473
in 55554
August 55799
it 56262
was 56786
only 56797
a 57755
pleasant 58234
variation 58585

going 59520

the 63611

chat 67419
with 68423
the 68523
mistress 70091
of 70222

mansion 70532
For 71455
ten 74363
days 74371

we 74903
occupied 75187
Gauley 75247
Bridge 75957
all 76580
our 77505
information 78530
showed 78576
that 78584
General 79454
Wise 79965
was 80576
not 81814
likely 81817
to 82030
attempt 82882
the 83507
reconquest 83682
of 83741
the 84060
Kanawha 84722

His 85279

retrograde 85411
march 85587
ended 86293
at 87398
White 89098
Sulphur 89147
Springs 89339

His 92157
destruction 92295

abandonment 93885
of 94208
stores 94521
and 94656
munitions 94686
of 94883
war 97266
showed 98785
that 98955
he 99283
intended 100149
to 100292
take 100684
final 101034
leave 101261

The 113580

promise 114453
and 114480
performance 114614
in 114686
his 115042
case 115817
had 115879
been 115897
ludicrous 115966
When 115981
we 116484
entered 117292
the 117543
valley 117996
we 118331
heard 119271
of 119446
his 119615
proclamations 119819
and 120057
orders 120096
which 120465
breathed 121207
the 121332
spirit 121452
of 121735
desperate 122216
hand-to-hand 122325
conflict 122891
His 123007
soldiers 123200
had 123815
been 123833
told 123851
to 123861
despise 124368
long-range 124577
fire-arms 124797
and 125076
to 125556
trust 126886
to 127852
bowie-knives 127966
which 128160
our 128414
invading 128619
hordes 128708
would 128731
never 129221
dare 129245
to 129605
face 130087
We 130815
found 131188
some 131292
of 132267
these 132542
knives 132877
among 133189
the 133300
arms 134009
we 134432
captured 135256
at 135857
the 136483
Gauley 136519
--ferocious-looking 137241
weapons 137386
made 137405
of 138981
broad 139194
files 139979
ground 140078
to 140595
a 140611
double 140762
edge 141404
fitted 141443
with 141910
rough 142538
handles 142626
and 143423
still 143718
bearing 144220
the 144376
cross-marking 144491

the 145589
file 145796
on 145860
the 145981
flat 145987
sides 146032
Such 146261
arms 146476
pointed 146514
many 146539
a 146583
sarcasm 146962
among 147132
our 147262
soldiers 147299
who 147312
had 147451
found 147934
it 148314
hard 148816
in 148949
the 149057
latter 149557
part 149710

our 150062

within 150989
even 151186
the 151824
longest 152158
musket-range 152664
of 152673
the 153739
enemy's 154310
column 154683
It 154845
was 155096
not 155457
strange 155519
that 155821
ignorant 156060
men 156341
should 157905
think 157950
they 157973

weapons 158626
less 158655

organized 63661
It 125435
shows 161046
the 9548
melodramatic 31572
truculence 63824
which 28

Wagner's 10642
plans 10652
enough 10685
to 10715
feel 10758
that 10764
he 10797
had 10815
made 10827
them 10836
his 10854
own 10890
and 10896
then 10912
went 10934
back 10972
to 11001
Rosecrans's 11009
headquarters 11036
where 11046
he 11051
was 11058
met 11068
with 11074
an 11096
appointment 11180
as 11186
brigadier-general 11220
and 11240
was 11244
relieved 11273
of 11319
staff 11324
duty 11349
He 11396
was 11407
a 11416
stout 11430
red-faced 11432
man 11437
with 11468
a 11486
blustering 11529
air 11534
dictatorial 11544
and 11559
assuming 11575

army 11662
engineer 11688
of 11704
twenty-five 11732
years' 11749
standing 11768
He 11777
was 11786
no 11831
doubt 11836
well 11863
skilled 11908
in 11911
the 11936
routine 11957
of 11990
his 12028
profession 12067
but 12092
broke 12112
down 12128
when 12175
burdened 12202
with 12213
the 12254
responsibility 12257
of 12285
conducting 12309
the 12312
movement 12343
of 12346
troops 12391
in 12441
the 12472

Wagner 12513

young 12852
man 12887

He 12946
fell 12966
at 12978
the 13000

of 13057
Yorktown 13063
in 13081
the 13140
next 13227
year 13289
Whittlesey 13309
was 13336
a 13378
veteran 13381
whose 13403
varied 13406
experience 13430
in 13459
and 13477
out 13494

had 13668
all 13734
been 13774
turned 13796
to 13808
good 13826
account 13849
He 13891
was 13911
already 13920
growing 13948
old 13985
but 14004
was 14052
indefatigable 14054
pushing 14086
about 14113
in 14145
a 14168
rather 14187
prim 14197
precise 14205
way 14228
advising 14241
wisely 14255

dryly 14330

bring 14548
every 14627
department 14666
into 14677

We 15950
fortified 15974
the 16007

filled 16964
with 16993
earth 17007

run 17027
along 17058
the 17079
margin 17111
of 17143
Gauley 17158
River 17170
till 17172
it 17197
reached 17214
a 17282
creek 17309
coming 17346
down 17350
from 17399
the 17457
hills 17477
on 17570

There 17699

a 17826

or 17841
two 17846

made 17907
commanding 17924
a 17932

above 17989
and 17999
the 18004
infantry 18016

followed 18054
the 18092
line 18133

the 18179

On 18415
the 18426

of 18483
Gauley 18487
Mount 18496
facing 18524
our 18593
post 18608
we 18610
slashed 18644
the 18668
timber 18671
from 18690
the 18712
edge 18727
of 18792
the 18811
precipice 18824
nearly 18826
to 18840
the 18850
top 18867
of 18887
the 18918
mountain 18946
making 18976
an 18991
entanglement 19068
through 19086
which 19154
it 19261
was 19307
impossible 19322
that 19343
any 19374
body 19380
of 19412
troops 19421
should 19470
move 19478
Down 19508
the 19535
Kanawha 19554
below 19573
the 19588
falls 19645
we 19683
strengthened 19693
the 19701
saw-mill 19708
with 19753
logs 19775
till 19779
it 19794
became 19820
a 19829
block-house 19870
loopholed 19884
for 19965
musketry 20011
commanding 20014
the 20072
road 20097

Charleston 20145
the 20177
ferry 20204
and 20222

A 20470
single 20506
cannon 20544
was 20598
here 20606
put 20634
in 20737
position 20748
also 20780
All 20817
this 20865
took 20898
time 20903
for 20912
so 20947
small 20976
a 21000
force 21021
as 21026
ours 21056
could 21087
not 21105
make 21109
very 21172
heavy 21185
details 21242
of 21257
working 21272
parties 21286
especially 21307
as 21325
our 21338
outpost 21371
and 21388
reconnoitring 21397
duty 21417
was 21450
also 21458
very 21470
laborious 21478
This 21494
duty 21524
was 21545
done 21580
by 21589
infantry 21643
for 21678
cavalry 21698
I 21713
had 21729
none 21741
except 21759
the 21764
squad 21829
of 21932
mounted 21980
messengers 21988
who 21999
kept 22010
carefully 22017
out 22053
of 22096
harm's 22114
way 22149
more 22197
to 22254
save 22284
their 22319
horses 22327
than 22340
themselves 22349
for 22352
they 22375
had 22418
been 22429
enlisted 22462
under 22500
an 22506
old 22526
law 22572
which 22590
paid 22619
them 22641
for 22649
the 22683
risk 22710
of 22713
their 22728
own 22768
horses 22784
which 22794
risk 22820
they 22838
naturally 22845
tried 22875
to 22887
make 22917
as 22947
small 22989
as 22992
possible 23023
My 23044
reconnoitring 23093
parties 23112
reached 23132
Big 23164

Mountain 23228
thirty-five 23277
miles 23321
up 23343
New 23409

Summersville 23478
twenty 23490
miles 23501
up 23547
the 23554
Gauley 23590
and 23650
made 23666
excursions 23698
into 23731
the 23743
counties 23760
on 23812
the 23818
left 23832

thirty 24006
or 24023
forty 24033
miles 24066
away 24078
These 24085
were 24117
not 24146
exceptional 24181
marches 24240
but 24273
were 24284
kept 24313
up 24326
with 24335
an 24350
industry 24366
that 24376
gave 24391
the 24424
enemy 24454
an 24475
exaggerated 24508
idea 24537
of 24559
our 24595
strength 24640
as 24678
well 24751
as 24767
of 24820
our 24845
activity 24853
About 24870
the 24895
10th 24902
of 24917
August 24923
we 24944
began 24990
to 25024
get 25027
rumors 25047
from 25052
the 25122
country 25150
that 25163
General 25179

his 81857
unfortunate 81889
affair 81928
was 81935
treated 81954
as 81965
a 81993
lesson 82010
from 82024

It 82357
made 82391
trouble 82427
in 82452
the 82492

however 82537
where 82595
the 82620
line 82629
officers 82640
did 82659
not 82663
conceal 82684
their 82701
opinion 82737
that 82750
he 82767
had 82771
failed 82817
in 82909
his 82960
duty 82990
as 83012
a 83022
commander 83065
and 83067
he 83091
was 83126
never 83216

quite 83320
comfortable 83361

Gauley 83949

unceremonious 84091

he 84204
came 84209
to 84212
me 84320
crying 84331
with 84358
shame 84447
and 84462
said 84472
General 84477
I 84513
have 84524
behaved 84527
like 84538
a 84607
miserable 84637
coward 84801
I 84848
ought 84868
to 84911
be 84923
cashiered 84982
and 85004
repeated 85124
many 85136
such 85142
expressions 85176
of 85201
remorse 85211
I 85246
comforted 85277
him 85325
by 85425
saying 85459
that 85568
the 85577
intensity 85579
of 85593
his 85621
own 85631
feeling 85707
was 85715
the 85726
best 85745
proof 85790
that 85794
he 85851
had 85870
only 85958
yielded 85967
to 86010
a 86041
surprise 86107
and 86139
that 86259
it 86295
was 86310
clear 86340
he 86389
was 86450
no 86459
coward 86460
He 86512
died 86521
afterward 86532
at 86577
the 86592
head 86667
of 86670
his 86689

for 124468

moment 124528
quite 124543
serious 124557
consequences 124643
The 124674

All 125667

overworked 125728

it 125851

the 125952

The 129207
men 129233
began 129253
to 129268
demur 129323
in 129328
a 129355
half-mutinous 129466

saying 129517
they 129543
had 129558
been 129678
on 129732
picket 129786
the 129798
night 129839
before 129960
Conine 129986
who 130111
was 130126
a 130169
soldierly 130197
man 130280
informed 130312
them 130359
that 130403
that 130414
should 130454
be 130534
immediately 130645
looked 130679
into 130686
and 130761
if 130769
so 130791
they 130825
would 130846
be 130857
soon 130868
relieved 130919
but 131019
that 131045
they 131096
could 131106
not 131170
argue 131217
the 131239
matter 131260
there 131271
as 131298
their 131344
company 131393
commander 131423
was 131449
responsible 131516
for 131537
the 131584
detail 131597
He 131612
therefore 131622
repeated 131627
his 131644
order 131654
The 131721
sergeant 131745
then 131793
became 131808
excited 131830
and 131852
said 131872
his 131892
men 131906
should 131936
not 131951
obey 131979
Lieutenant 132028

the 132078
district 132102
commissary 132132

standing 132173

drawing 132201
his 132227
pistol 132234
said 132236
to 132258
Joyce 132287
That's 132303
mutiny 132334
order 132346
your 132352
men 132365
to 132387
take 132412
the 132425
tools 132489
or 132505
I'll 132536
shoot 132558
you 132563

retorted 132691
with 132698
a 132719
curse 132743
Shoot 132757
Gibbs 132792
fired 132844

Joyce 132938
fell 132950
dead 132996

refused 133159

intending 133693
very 133714
properly 133742
to 133760
put 133771
the 133796
man 133823
in 133828
arrest 133887
but 133919
the 133943
shot 133956
followed 133971
too 134015
quick 134055
for 134097
the 134119
guard 134147
to 134167
arrive 134192
I 134197
was 134240
sitting 134245
within 134268
the 134276
house 134326
at 134334
my 134346
camp 134368
desk 134394
busy 134420
when 134447
the 134451
first 134464
thing 134521
which 134564
attracted 134581
my 134586
attention 134626
was 134651
the 134672
call 134681
for 134686
the 134696
guard 134709
and 134711
the 134753
shot 134757
I 134772
ran 134811
out 134834
not 134869
stopping 134878
for 134949
arms 134977
and 134989
saw 135010
some 135029
of 135031
the 135049
men 135062
running 135082
off 135113
shouting 135125
Go 135152
for 135158
your 135163
guns 135180
kill 135192
him 135206
kill 135227
him 135260
I 135268
stopped 135271
part 135296
of 135337
the 135364
men 135407
ordered 135409
them 135418
to 135427
take 135439
the 135475
sergeant 135495
quickly 135525
to 135579
the 135644
hospital 135654
thinking 135657
he 135706
might 135717
not 135742
be 135773
dead 135831
I 135847
then 135944
ordered 135954
Gibbs 135971
in 135992
arrest 135999
till 136032
an 136067
investigation 136128
should 136187
be 136189
made 136221
and 136248
ran 136278
at 136359
speed 136400
to 136404
a 136422
gap 136429
in 136465
the 136469
hedge 136494
which 136513
opened 136522
into 136532
the 136541
regimental 136607
camp 136627
It 136666
was 136676
not 136696
a 136749
moment 136787
too 136808
soon 136863
The 136988
men 137022
with 137036
their 137060
muskets 137147
were 137149
already 137175
clustering 137214
in 137223
the 137295
path 137304
threatening 137312
vengeance 137365
on 137371
Mr 137397
Gibbs 137416
I 137468
ordered 137479
them 137500
to 137538
halt 137569
and 137628
return 137672
to 137724
their 137779
quarters 137785
Carried 137798
away 137807
by 137877
excitement 137913
they 137941
levelled 137988
their 138094
muskets 138107
at 138135
me 138187
and 138220
bade 138239
me 138270
get 138293
out 138301
of 138340
their 138365
way 138401
or 138405
they 138410
would 138454
shoot 138469
me 138523
I 138525
managed 138536
to 138546
keep 138548
cool 138572
said 138589
the 138633
affair 138693
would 138765
be 138794
investigated 138966
that 139052
Gibbs 139064
was 139085
already 139127
under 139136
arrest 139146
but 139154
they 139157
must 139161
go 139179
back 139201
to 139214
their 139236
quarters 139253
The 139268
parley 139293
lasted 139304
long 139364
enough 139399
to 139425
bring 139429
some 139468
of 139554
their 139556
officers 139592
near 139625
I 139627
ordered 139634
them 139651
to 139683
come 139754
to 139769
my 139811
side 139833
and 139838
then 139857
to 139871
take 139894
command 139938
of 139962
the 139986
men 139993
and 140019
march 140030
them 140044
away 140093
The 140112
real 140127
danger 140154
was 140174
over 140194
as 140273
soon 140300
as 140331
the 140339
first 140366
impulse 140382
was 140390
checked 140395

The 140567
men 140587
then 140609
began 140658
to 140675
feel 140682
some 140698
of 140713
their 140738
natural 140764
respect 140793
for 140802
their 140880
commander 140902
and 140949
yielded 140996
probably 141098
the 141125
more 141146
readily 141262
because 141364
they 141381
noticed 141403
that 141427
I 141433
was 141442
unarmed 141469
I 141527
thought 141540
it 141552
wise 141576
to 141589
be 141594
content 141631
with 141658
quelling 141675
the 141724
disturbance 141746
and 141764
did 141805
not 141837
seek 141849
out 141873
for 141879
punishment 141940
the 141966
men 141980
who 142036
had 142044
met 142147
me 142156
at 142196
the 142262
gap 142270
Their 142274
excitement 142277
had 142308
been 142313
natural 142337
under 142339
the 142400
circumstances 142419
which 142444
were 142447
reported 142474
with 142480
exaggeration 142495
as 142569
a 142581
wilful 142597
murder 142601
If 142628
I 142652
had 142677
been 142725
in 142741
command 142807
of 142898
a 142915
larger 142933
force 142943
it 142958
would 142971
have 143012
been 143028
easy 143051
to 143063
turn 143072
out 143077
another 143089
regiment 143092
to 143103
enforce 143127
order 143139
and 143147
arrest 143240
any 143295

we 144753
were 144768
constantly 144821
skirmishing 144836
I 144857
could 144868
not 144871
do 144923
otherwise 144945
than 144980
meet 144998
the 145017

instantly 145086

had 152050
reached 152105

stopped 155481
by 155522

Rosecrans 155583

it 155688
unwise 155696
to 155731

many 63856

look 6610
of 14907
surprise 15978
in 16107
my 21899
face 28965
and 31991
his 58919
own 66759
broadened 66892
humorously 70114
as 85810
his 85830
manner 98990
changed 122721
from 134101
vehemence 134126
to 142572
geniality 142587
General 142730
Bates 143589
and 144275
he 144809
were 145503
familiar 145522
acquaintances 145556
at 145638
the 146187
bar 146292
in 146305
Cincinnati 146357
and 150353
McCook 154056
had 161638
evidently 161896
presumed 2499
upon 16009
this 58364
as 58511
a 58906
warrant 59117
for 59126
speaking 60770
his 140415
mind 142808
as 143467
he 143743
pleased 143932
When 144169
he 144241
reported 145256
to 145711
me 145757
at 1326
this 56705
later 145217
period 58653
I 175211
found 181748
a 9709
hearty 52330
and 53642
loyal 150089
character 6589
under 83564
his 134582
bluff 54483
exterior 123231
and 63896
rough 15846
speech 5705
with 13917
real 16655
courage 36741
a 40963
quick 46261
eye 48855
for 61050
topography 73110
and 74172
no 74217
lack 76294
of 77738
earnest 82514
subordination 89878
when 103759
work 111726
was 114200
to 114979
be 131732
done 138194
Although 167464
our 168227
service 173602
together 176804
was 185237
short 2025
I 111388
learned 23980
to 26099
have 33844
real 39012
respect 44904
for 45830
him 65794
and 68973
sincerely 72777
mourned 72963
his 73096
loss 78667
when 95311
later 97535
in 99847
the 102771
war 106920
he 109151
met 114737
his 116702
tragic 122170
death 122874
The 132111
other 132160
brigade 132255
commander 151441
was 165396
Colonel 165637

P 80478
Scammon 122255
of 163398
the 163870
Twenty-third 167050
Ohio 34864
He 44517
had 52052
graduated 71554
from 96897
West 108853
Point 112566
in 114263
and 168065
had 59000
served 146411
in 160423
the 170019
Topographical 6339
Engineers 144038
of 144097
the 144132
regular 144148
army 158244
and 6488
as 65958
instructor 68131
in 83886
the 94937
Military 144129
Academy 145005
In 150139
the 154512
Mexican 154668
War 158111
he 75751
had 82235
been 16842
aide-de-camp 65891
to 69842
General 139078
Scott 175085
He 65047
had 6594
been 64613
out 81134
of 124741
the 7477
army 7404
for 38994
some 44594
years 83517
before 130443
the 150649
rebellion 154818
and 1301
was 13236
acting 27807
as 34663
professor 56680
of 57640
mathematics 61712
in 63369
St 65394
Xavier's 38975
College 57151
Cincinnati 57182
when 125424
he 8370
was 113949
appointed 58443
to 154832
the 158127
colonelcy 151549
of 156338
the 12009
Twenty-third 141550
Ohio 431
upon 442
Rosecrans's 502
promotion 3582
Like 5270
Rosecrans 7235
he 9036
was 14941
a 16963
Roman 18245
Catholic 18779
though 21399
himself 22452
of 26230
Puritan 31738
descent 41867
It 42726
seems 43509
that 43533
at 51638
the 51734
time 52864
of 52867
the 54019
Puseyite 54107
movement 54685
in 55308
England 55910
and 56091
in 56128
this 56134
country 56156
there 57585
had 57597
been 57711
a 58023
good 58033
many 58044
conversions 58094
to 59864
Romanism 60986
among 61548
the 62240
students 63157
and 63598
teachers 63773
at 63827
West 64114
Point 64592
under 65097
the 65296
influence 65374
of 73746
the 73763
chaplain 74125
of 78997
the 79314
post 83561
and 84623
Scammon 85044
among 85207
a 87072
number 87083
of 87695
young 88264
men 91008
who 91023
subsequently 91383
became 93240
distinguished 93254
officers 93270
was 93282
in 93298
this 93312
number 93646
It 94499
need 98801
hardly 98815
be 106980
said 109572
that 109722
Scammon 109727
was 110817
well 110827
instructed 112930
in 117762
his 117989
profession 121509
He 121520
was 121695
perhaps 122261
too 123479
much 123940
wedded 123943
to 124972
the 125729
routine 126299
of 127209
the 127283
service 128181
and 128225
was 130006
looked 130108
upon 130115
by 140888
his 141070
subordinates 141120
as 141400
a 141436
martinet 141458
who 141466
had 141508
not 142061
patience 143048
enough 143203
with 143277
the 143406
inexperience 145509
of 145515
volunteer 146611
soldiers 147601
He 151955
was 155015
one 155057
of 155329
the 155340
older 155363
men 155376
of 155606
our 157159
army 159868
somewhat 160080
under 160316
the 160606
average 160707
height 160716
and 161172
weight 161609
with 168743
a 180012
precise 181496
politeness 181665
of 182033
manner 182320
which 182467
reminded 183005
one 183034
of 183101
a 183125
Frenchman 183161
and 183248
the 183264
resemblance 183273
was 183493
increased 183939
by 184135
his 184958
free 184992
use 185115
of 185149
his 185245
snuff-box 185287
His 185365
nervous 185375
irritability 35924
was 160116
the 11634
cause 62523
of 96431
considerable 123204
chafing 125326
in 151277
his 153988
command 170765
but 13883
this 65456
left 81572
him 114676
under 144310
fire 9580
and 112906
those 139893
who 155289
had 155355
been 69798
with 104780
him 123926
in 149281
action 163186
learned 176065
to 184706
admire 103044
his 9624
courage 60569
and 158428
conduct 3986
He 7970
was 80577
with 82860
me 116371
subsequently 118998
at 162162
South 174356
Mountain 73281
and 130210
Antietam 7436
and 8171
still 11333
later 22783
had 31604
the 55405
misfortune 56459
to 58586
be 80230
one 141847
of 153148
those 153864
prisoners 155466
in 155491
the 155520
Confederates' 155624
hands 166924
who 166945
were 1389
exposed 2928
to 21303
the 21374
fire 42161
of 54416
our 56768
batteries 57703
in 60999
front 63990
of 64748
Charleston 64886
S 66713
C 67566
But 85857
being 86334
a 87145
subordinate 87781
I 87872
was 88559
most 101331
interested 109896
in 121566
the 121617
characteristics 121751
of 124563
our 131685
commander 140897
Our 142071
Camp 146400
Dennison 146606
acquaintance 151593
had 157599
been 158761
a 160455
pleasant 160670
one 162486
and 163200
he 163240
greeted 172342
me 174202
with 181511
a 3115
cordiality 169621
that 3141
was 120671
reassuring 175876
His 6234
general 6360
appearance 7444
was 17023
attractive 19736
He 21533
was 28620
tall 31488
but 31522
not 35202
heavy 35827
with 36068
the 51745
rather 51817
long 51827
head 51859
and 52269
countenance 58029
that 61577
is 61670
sometimes 62446
called 62483
Norman 74769
His 81872
aquiline 96925
nose 102791
and 104260
bright 106763
eyes 117202
gave 122673
him 126523
an 134680
incisive 141970
expression 153660
increased 157708
by 159776
rapid 160243
utterance 160510
in 161729
his 161921
speech 161962
which 164283
was 173809
apt 174495
to 174908
grow 176037
hurried 2099
almost 111462
to 279
stammering 1341
when 1380
he 1398
was 1596
excited 1712
His 2189
impulsiveness 2201
was 2216
plain 3447
to 5360
all 5502
who 6010
approached 6039
him 6079
his 6567
irritation 6614
quickly 6744
flashed 7109
out 8723
in 8787
words 8909
when 8927
he 8962
was 9028
crossed 9044
and 9314
his 9388
social 9590
geniality 9638
would 9757
show 10332
itself 10428
in 11528
smiles 11822
and 11859
in 11920
almost 12198
caressing 13936
gestures 14018
when 14394
he 14564
was 15891
pleased 16002
In 16190
discussing 18726
military 20779
questions 21118
he 21151
made 21220
free 21877
use 23250
of 24152
his 24328
theoretic 24375
knowledge 25087
often 26691
quoted 27139
authorities 27551
and 27831
cited 27941
maxims 28164
of 28497
war 32014
and 32090
compared 34699
the 38627
problem 38652
before 38811
him 39398
to 39527
analogous 39679
cases 41915
in 42019
military 43137
history 43631
This 44642
did 45784
not 46876
go 48369
far 50045
enough 50323
to 50366
be 50704
pedantic 50736
and 52645
was 53240
full 53820
of 54332
a 54501
lively 54542
intelligence 54814
yet 55078
it 55285
did 55963
not 56139
impress 56720
me 56759
as 56777
that 56787
highest 56900
form 57039
of 57333
military 58343
insight 58463
and 58537
knowledge 58771
which 58847
solves 58952
the 59041
question 59141
before 59228
it 59361
upon 59415
its 59448
own 59770
merits 59792
and 59825
without 59889
conscious 59921
comparison 60284
with 60302
historical 60424
examples 61480
through 61594
a 62033
power 62251
of 62284
judgment 62314
and 62327
perception 62509
ripened 62521
and 62574
broadened 62662
by 62787
the 62797
mastery 63142
of 63184
principles 63232
which 63341
have 63612
ruled 64159
the 64205
great 64439
campaigns 64504
of 64543
the 64561
world 64574
He 64628
was 64680
fond 64798
of 65431
conviviality 65466
loved 65533
to 65574
banter 65625
good-humoredly 65699
his 66116
staff 66579
officers 66674
and 67471
intimates 67721
and 68555
was 68599
altogether 70077
an 70096
attractive 70389
and 70490
companionable 70677
man 75438
with 75487
intellectual 75570
activity 75669
enough 75766
to 75846
make 76068
his 76493
society 77076
stimulating 77245
and 77298
full 77878
of 78427
lively 80445
discussion 80504
I 80542
could 80653
easily 80967
understand 81167
Garfield's 81204
saying 81586
in 81635
his 81751
letter 81845
to 82324
Secretary 82334
Chase 82346
which 82373
afterward 82470
became 82801
the 83111
subject 83121
of 83288
much 83323
debate 83553
that 83615
he 83675
loved 83742
every 83780
bone 84155
in 84211
his 84354
body 84389

An 84512
anecdote 85237
told 85315
at 85529

is 88445
so 88601
characteristic 88815
of 89242
Rosecrans 89573
that 89646
it 89817
is 89849
worth 89894
repeating 89952
After 89977
the 90184

of 90887
Stone's 90928

made 102037
by 102355
Governor 102644
Tod 102686
a 102830
member 102911
of 103279
a 103386
commission 103389
sent 104416
to 104585
look 108697
after 108963
the 109700
wounded 113284
soldiers 117299
He 117567
called 117585
on 117770
General 118228
Rosecrans 118291
at 118500
his 118878
headquarters 118890
in 118905
Murfreesboro 120336

among 121035

During 123506
the 123595
visit 123636
Rosecrans 123816
was 123834
called 123852
aside 123862
but 123955
in 124066
the 124128
same 124168
room 124205
by 124215
a 124226
staff 124291
officer 124340
to 124371
receive 124398
information 124488
about 124578
a 124621

had 124892
been 124965
caught 125158
within 125204
the 125211

The 125351
general 125397
got 125450
quite 125848
excited 125877
over 126007
the 126160
information 126641
talked 126884
loudly 126950

the 185105

the 151140

estimate 52947
of 53110
them 53171
which 53215
I 53247
have 54132
given 54647
but 55333
it 55494
was 55546
a 55624

for 139937
the 152569

to 150809
my 151913

in 154501
the 154743

feeling 157203
a 159159
sense 8287
of 12812
relief 20692
at 25900
the 29908
transfer 32963
of 73172
responsibility 96484
to 107076

under 176481
the 36033
orders 66878

the 18273

the 31787
difficulties 32523
of 70877

I 50009
was 50036
confident 50043
there 50274
was 50422
some 50495
mistake 50587
about 51105
it 51213
He 51555
was 51653
however 51720
so 51722
earnest 51831
in 51889
his 51906
assertions 51908
that 51973
he 52009
could 52450
not 52470
be 52472
mistaken 52621
that 52835
McCook 52854
in 52857
whose 53115
brigade 53120
he 53142
was 53220
sent 53233
out 53438
an 53531
officer 53586
with 53589
some 53920
men 54012
guided 54091
by 54098
the 54175
wagon-master 54253
to 54502
verify 54551
the 54590
report 54717
The 54797
story 54990
was 54992
confirmed 55188
and 55190
the 55230
matter 55310
was 55859
brought 56046
to 56625
me 56916
for 56989
action 56991
Puzzled 57003
but 57025
not 57028
convinced 57089
and 57136
thinking 57227
that 57247
as 57390
McCook's 57426
command 57428
was 57453
new 57652
to 57717
the 58270
country 58475
it 58576
would 58742
be 58941
better 58947
to 59047
send 59129
some 59407
one 59413
who 59553
was 59576
used 59579
to 59734
scouting 60062
in 60406
the 60686
mountains 60688
I 60714
ordered 60742
a 60771
lieutenant 60992
named 61131
Bontecou 61429
of 61431
the 61434
Second 61652
Kentucky 61766
Regiment 61795
to 61877
take 61917
a 61924
small 61957
party 61964
and 62003
examine 62005
the 62115
case 62236
anew 62299
Bontecou 62338
had 62441
done 62824
a 62877
good 62890
deal 63143
of 63145
successful 63242
work 63248
in 63287
this 63587
line 63698
and 63744
was 63866
regarded 63982
as 64050
a 64246
good 64290
woodsman 64294
and 64440
an 64451
enterprising 64866
scout 64896
He 64898
too 65052
came 65191
back 65197
at 65219
nightfall 65236
saying 65254
that 65534
there 65610
could 65621
be 65753
no 65954
mistake 65987
about 66141
it 66252
He 66255
had 66306
crept 66423
close 66436
to 66438
the 66471
sentinels 66902
of 66904
the 66972
camp 67171
had 67418
counted 67499
the 67501
tents 67539
and 67541
being 67897
challenged 67899
by 68028
the 68164
guard 68723
had 68725
made 68820
a 68822
run 68946
for 69774
it 69776
through 69952
the 69954
thicket 69974
losing 69982
his 70206
hat 70257
The 70449
position 70457
of 70905
the 70992
enemy 70994
was 71699
by 71971
all 72002
the 72054
reports 72087
about 72189
three 72519
miles 72635
from 72643
us 72645
diagonally 72961
in 72985
rear 73061
of 73175
our 73181
right 73305
flank 73307
It 73520
now 73635
seemed 73749
that 73769
it 73902
must 74099
be 74102
true 74602
that 75190
some 75192
detachment 75332
had 75338
been 75352
delayed 75395
in 75397
joining 75443
the 75445
retreating 75512
column 75527
and 75593
had 75614
found 75616
itself 75695
thus 75967
partly 75969
cut 76099
off 76149
by 76476
our 76659
advance 76763
I 77268
therefore 77747
ordered 77749
McCook 77882
to 77950
start 77952
at 78196
earliest 78258
peep 78260
of 78322
day 78367
upon 78369
the 78408
Chestnutburg 78443
road 78445
on 78617
which 78748
the 79070
wagon-master 79072
had 79205
been 79402
foraging 79450
and 79761
passing 79829
beyond 80206
the 80416
hostile 80421
detachment 80828
attack 81012
from 81156
the 81468
other 82082
side 82553
it 82783
being 82881
agreed 83009
by 83237
all 83366
the 83475
scouting 83659
parties 83724
that 83763
this 83958
would 84143
drive 84394
the 84396
enemy 84554
toward 84662
our 84717
camp 84780
My 84795
own 84807
brigade 84832
would 84901
be 85224
disposed 85334
of 85531
to 85554
intercept 85572
the 85872
enemy 86207
and 86209
prevent 86627
escape 87448
McCook 87450
moved 87462
out 87483
as 87603
ordered 87805
and 87850
following 88050
his 88085
guides 88474
came 88477
by 88541
many 88552
devious 88712
turns 88714
to 88742
a 88810
fork 88995
in 89004
the 89043
road 89045
following 89071
which 89255
they 89261
told 89266
him 89287
a 89578
few 89581
minutes 89734
would 89736
bring 89800
him 89874
upon 89978
the 90426
enemy 90519
He 90635
halted 90713
the 90716
column 90721
and 90813
with 90815
a 90858
small 91159
skirmishing 91200
party 91234
went 91236
carefully 91297
forward 91379
The 91499
guides 91577
pointed 91613
to 91700
a 91727
thicket 91936
from 92058
which 92070
the 92072
Confederates 92277
could 92320
be 92407
seen 92500
His 92524
instinct 92594
for 92682
topography 92799
had 92890
made 93167
him 93188
suspect 93372
the 93531
truth 93780
as 93844
he 94059
had 94073
noted 94213
the 94306
courses 94436
in 94559
advancing 94783
and 94820
crawling 94906
through 94985
the 95785
thicket 95924
he 96229
looked 96253
out 96718
from 96728
the 96844
other 96847
side 96868
upon 97023
what 97295
he 97321
at 97427
once 97912
recognized 97951
as 97963
the 97965
rear 98085
of 98189
his 98663
own 98954
camp 99087
and 99145
the 99149
tents 99203
of 99409
the 99472
very 99660
regiment 99662
from 99670
which 99850
he 100086
had 100088
sent 100414
an 100604
officer 100769
to 100807
test 100813
the 100825
wagon-master's 100903
report 101311
All 101633
the 102024
scouts 102029
had 102140
been 102143
so 102171
deceived 102186
by 102422
the 102436
tangle 102443
of 102537
wooded 102639
hills 102674
and 102803
circling 102806
roads 102916
that 102992
they 102994
fully 103091
believed 103093
they 103170
were 103248
still 103250
miles 103427
from 103462
our 103745
position 104012
and 104049
bewildered 104207
in 104639
the 104712
labyrinth 104777
they 104848
were 105028
sure 105030
the 105234
tents 105319
they 105684
saw 105686
were 105773
the 105809
enemy's 105842
and 106482
not 106692
ours 106865
The 106935
march 107087
had 107132
been 107185
through 107413
rain 107415
and 107460
mist 107682
through 107684
dripping 107996
thickets 107998
and 108246
on 108294
muddy 108761
roads 109032
and 109165
the 109235
first 109237
impulse 109359
was 109363
wrath 109672
at 109674
the 109779
erring 109997
scouts 110041
but 110094
the 110126
ludicrous 110156
side 110820
soon 110896
prevailed 111017
and 111301
officers 111681
and 111683
men 111951
joined 111959
in 111970
hearty 111995
laughter 112188
over 112267

wild-goose 112401

The 134565
position 134567
was 134759
a 134852
very 134855
strong 134871
one 134873
for 134978
resisting 135032
an 135095
approach 135100
from 135207

was 135349
commanded 135457
by 135574
higher 135664

The 135930
true 136284

was 136563
two 136757

further 136811
on 136813

there 136967
alone 137248
could 137271
we 137273
successfully 137423
bar 137651
the 137831
way 137924
against 137926
a 137974

coming 138328

the 138498

I 138731
therefore 138733

the 139273

properly 140904
hold 140923

we 140969

such 141378
cover 141628
as 141639
we 141641
could 141672

all 143245

forced 148378
it 148697
to 148791
retire 148808
to 148810
a 148958
ridge 149117
out 149294
of 149362
range 149461
of 149562
our 149587
artillery 149589
We 149636
dismounted 150105
one 150302
of 150315
his 150354
howitzers 150379
in 150694
the 150696
engagement 150816
but 150835
contented 150866
ourselves 150868
with 150920
making 150964
him 151541
yield 151738
the 151784
ground 151920
which 152235
would 153002
interfere 153185
with 153545
our 153696
easy 153903
holding 154347
of 154387
our 154734
own 154968
position 154993
and 155079
the 155093
spurs 155236
of 155614
the 155765
mountain 155811
directly 155910
connected 155919
with 156059
it 156075
Wise 156089
had 156557
learned 156617
that 156718
Rosecrans 156788
was 156790
not 157129
with 157152
my 157241
column 157647
and 157649
on 157662
the 157912
supposition 157937
that 158070
the 158269
advance 158296
was 158298
made 158341
by 158353
my 158355

Lee 158578
concluded 158630
to 158876
order 158884
Floyd 158886
to 159019
Wise's 159021
camp 159138
being 159179
now 159190
satisfied 159540
that 159543
no 159545
movement 159877
of 159955
our 160019
troops 160182
had 160450
been 160556
made 160682
by 160692
way 160754
of 160808
the 160810
Wilderness 160937
road 160952
It 161167
was 161169
at 161246
this 161262
time 161392
that 161400
Wise 161402
was 161691
relieved 161693
of 161994
command 162039
and 162041
ordered 162269
to 162426
Richmond 162466
and 162469
Lee 162558
found 162701
it 162708
advisable 162732
to 162756
unite 162758
his 162771
forces 162773
and 162842
take 162977
command 162979
in 163027

dated 165610

to 165721
the 165752
capture 165821
of 165826
John 165854

the 166665

his 167029
State 167031

from 167728

the 167788
prisoner 168038
whose 168294
execution 168399
at 168401

then 170112
Buchanan's 170114
Secretary 170474
of 170620
War 170643

ordered 170746
Lee 171053
with 171055
the 171070
detachment 171092
of 171306
marines 171466
to 171468
Harper's 171479
Ferry 171481
where 171524
they 171526
stormed 171750
the 171842

which 172449
Brown 172538
had 172543
made 172672

with 172943
such 172977
men 173124

such 175005
a 175426
history 175446
behind 175506
them 175525
it 175698
can 175751
easily 175753
be 175796
understood 176045
that 176299
Lee 176316
would 176347
feel 176550
no 176553
ordinary 176661
delicacy 176663
in 176668
asserting 176670
his 176799

no 176854
common 176872
embarrassment 176973
at 176975
their 177049

Rosecrans 177170

It 182351
is 182724
true 182963

by 130912

I 164685

General 175025
Rosecrans 175637
came 176604
in 26916
person 83846
to 120565
my 120692

He 154776
had 159672

the 7281

the 22075

continued 87438
almost 87831
without 100575

In 137603
the 140950

the 12612

a 21887
fearfully 22903

whilst 27843
Rosecrans 34775
was 37126
still 42539
my 42601
tent-mate 51272
He 66596
had 69090
heard 69398
rumors 69750
of 69924
fighting 70950
at 75381
the 79765
front 86977
and 87046
had 87317
hurried 88467
forward 88481
with 88497
a 88572
couple 88821
of 89350
staff 100433

but 114023
without 114286

My 127587

were 143655

the 150288
gentlemen 152211
who 161320
had 162918
accompanied 175350
Rosecrans 50657
but 80349
the 86885
new-comers 131265
were 6863
made 12536
heartily 15711
welcome 75577
to 78991
what 82182
we 82865
had 127615
In 128477
my 145492
own 146484

General 45260
Rosecrans 62880
occupied 98106
my 107283
camp 138639
cot 148586
I 155845
had 179880
improvised 182492
a 5540
rough 14314
bunk 25593
for 74631
myself 79223
on 106652
the 111207
other 112526
side 131822
of 131887
the 149942

but 180369
as 180930
General 184812
Schenck 10348
got 145835
in 179270
too 31878
late 29736
for 35444
the 117739
construction 9613
of 33029
any 76211
better 180565
resting-place 5107
he 5947
was 30837
obliged 126151
to 142235
content 156327
himself 182549
with 182802
a 182983
bed 183202
made 183387
of 183506
three 183643
or 184683
four 90473
camp-stools 6783
set 70079
in 83380
a 92981
row 30869
Anything 8777
was 17583
better 18171
than 21147
lying 21975
on 32527
the 46161
damp 49736
ground 82679
in 85547
such 85834
a 86341
storm 86843
but 94779
Schenck 102006
long 102052
remembered 115961
the 137495
aching 138701
weariness 145615
of 150687
that 159170
night 160061
as 170581
he 170959
balanced 172497
upon 177419
the 6825
narrow 7992
and 12238
unstable 21578
supports 26731
which 26977
threatened 48274
to 63522
tumble 67406
him 68948
upon 81385
the 82735
ground 83357
at 83635
the 83731
least 87416
effort 87849
to 91845
change 104757
the 110136
position 113111
of 116782
stiffened 119981
body 120788
and 140806
limbs 141895
One 144380
could 151623
not 154496
desire 156812
better 158632
companionship 165652
than 167534
we 179293
had 98647
during 15739
our 32012
waking 75557
hours 100550
for 124737
both 126904
my 150664
guests 170540
had 11292
had 14545
varied 103332
and 118368
interesting 175127
experience 4875
and 8933
knew 65203
how 94943
to 125867
make 131174
it 148609
the 66848
means 121093
of 38121
delightful 5303
social 8176
intercourse 15474
and 28865
discussion 30541
The 33410
chilly 78577
temperature 80845
of 96400
the 121031
tent 131139
was 137262
pleasantly 150673
modified 162440
by 175018
a 119906
furnace 1837
which 104790
was 111523
the 78833
successful 58257
invention 145016
of 44488
the 94455
private 96371
soldiers 25
A 58
square 567
trench 628
was 747
dug 896
from 931
the 948
middle 955
of 957
the 961
tent 1020
leading 1027
out 1049
behind 1054
it 1088
this 1131
was 1168
capped 1188
with 1342
flat 1457
stones 1479
three 1481
or 1495
four 1542
inches 1544
thick 1713
which 1717
were 1741
abundant 1760
on 1775
the 1791
mountain 1950
At 1989
the 1992
end 2042
of 2148
it 2304
on 2315
the 2380
outside 2388
a 2619
chimney 2643
of 2650
stones 2679
plastered 2841
with 2973
mud 2984
was 3033
built 3067
up 3071
and 3188
the 3322
whole 3423
topped 3474
out 3837
by 3905
an 4447
empty 4753
cracker-barrel 4883
by 5000
way 5007
of 5070
chimney-pot 5088
The 5713
fire 5813
built 6043
in 6094
the 6148
furnace 6215
had 6617
good 7148
draught 7473
and 7542
the 7644
thick 7812
stones 7965
held 8187
the 8206
heat 8314
well 8657
making 8872
on 9081
the 9186
whole 9213
the 9514
best 9710
means 10336
of 10554
warming 10782
a 11120
tent 11698
which 11756
I 11877
ever 11961
tried 11973
The 12211
objection 12550
to 12661
the 12909
little 12952
sheet-iron 13120
stoves 13297
furnished 13324
with 13466
the 13483
Sibley 13599
tent 13832
is 13952
that 14023
they 14211
are 14327
cold 14629
in 14692
a 14821
minute 14853
if 15217
the 15489
fire 15955
dies 15986
out 16017
The 16109
rains 16133
when 16152
once 16256
they 16548
began 16653
continued 16675
with 16700
such 16755
violence 16892
that 17045
the 17157
streams 17161
were 17195
soon 17241
up 17431
the 17671
common 17703
fords 17820
became 18039
impassable 18274
and 18355
the 18363
roads 18390
became 18412
so 18558
muddy 18582
and 18597
slippery 18673
that 18679
it 18871
was 18916
with 18978
the 19029
utmost 19038
difficulty 19115
our 19125
little 19181
army 19231
was 19311
supplied 19330
The 19378
four 19453
brigades 19467
were 19516
so 19545
reduced 19633
by 19832
sickness 20070
and 20158
by 20181
detachments 20215
that 20239
Rosecrans 20259
reported 20284
the 20297
whole 20346
as 20359

the 45950
condition 46025
of 46063
the 46362

had 46563

such 46716
that 46808
Rosecrans 46814
felt 47141
compelled 47402
to 47444
withdraw 47584

the 47942

the 50706

now 51131
rose 51164
above 51176
these 51207
high 51235

dwelling-houses 53419
built 53780
in 54055

was 54748
considered 54981
a 55129
neighborhood 55242
safe 55422
from 55486
floods 55537
The 55695
inundation 55793
almost 55876
stopped 55964
communication 56116
though 56218
our 56439
quartermasters 56721
tried 57865
to 58124
remedy 58664
part 58673
of 58789
the 59052
mischief 59756
by 59984
forcing 60020

near 60220
to 60239
the 60433
Kanawha 60706
Falls 60734
as 60790
possible 60795
But 61042
it 61243
was 61266
very 61317
difficult 61365
to 61421
protect 61624
the 61640
supplies 61827
landed 62193
upon 62599
a 62774
muddy 62844
bank 63058
where 63131
were 63316
no 64244
warehouses 64286
and 64297
no 64533
protection 64874
but 64894
canvas 64940
covers 65006
stretched 65656
over 65763
the 65785
piles 65787
of 66190
barrels 66651

boxes 66783
of 66950
bread 67009
and 67191
sacks 67822
of 67839
grain 67915
There 67924
was 68035
enormous 68242
waste 68433
and 68584
loss 68586
but 68588
we 68591
managed 68657
to 68684
keep 68776
our 68839
men 68878
in 69013
rations 69075
and 69102
were 69285
better 69377
off 69466
than 69510
the 69517
Confederates 69519
in 69529
regard 69539
to 69545
whom 69548
Floyd 69558
afterward 69589
reported 69827
to 69860
his 69890
government 70200
that 70275
the 70344
eleven 70360
days 70487
of 70742
cold 70763
storms 70785
at 70808
Sewell 70930
Mountain 71250
had 71430
cost 71442
more 71496
men 71517
sick 71691
and 71694
dead 71732
than 71744
the 71784
battle 71901
of 72052
Manassas 72253
Plains 72344
It 72381
has 72437
been 72444
asserted 72886
by 72911
Confederate 72922
writers 72946
that 73266
Lee 73697
was 73787
executing 73835
a 73837
movement 74017
to 74024
turn 74194
Rosecrans's 74289
left 74316
flank 74320
when 74579
the 74652
latter 74661
marched 74740
back 74820
from 74883
Sewell 75286
Mountain 75416
If 75581
so 75621
it 75709
certainly 76289
had 76409
not 76447
gone 76842
far 76860
enough 76952
to 76960
attract 76991
our 77028
attention 77453
and 77535
from 77582
my 77852
own 77867
knowledge 77918
of 77933
the 78001
situation 78016
I 78086
do 78239
not 78273
believe 78312
it 78326
had 78371
passed 78402
beyond 78458
the 78503
form 78526
of 78658
discussion 78808
of 78834
a 78915
possible 79239
movement 79281
when 79411
the 79651
weather 79816
should 79954
become 80007
settled 80051
Such 80061
plans 80661
were 80735
discussed 80841
on 80892
both 81111
sides 81328
but 81342
the 81415
physical 81533
condition 81854
of 81859
the 81907
country 82058
was 82105
an 82457
imperative 82548
veto 82601
upon 82635
aggressive 82791
action 83343
During 83839
the 84134
5th 84349
of 84436
October 84501
our 84522
sick 84650
and 85002
spare 85146
baggage 85298
were 85463
sent 85469
back 85492
to 85520
Camp 85769
Lookout 85825
Tents 85844
were 86006
struck 86057
at 86061
ten 86301
o'clock 86356
in 86646
the 86751
evening 86784
and 87327
the 87337
trains 87367
sent 87671
on 87705
their 87833
way 87841
under 88274
escort 88602
at 88606
eleven 88630
The 88649
column 88664
moved 88870
as 89247
soon 89359
as 89847
the 89912
trains 89937
were 90000
out 90028
of 90186
the 90250
way 90307
except 90343
my 90376
own 90381
brigade 90407
to 90507
which 90907
was 91215
assigned 91229
the 91304
duty 91419
of 91704
rear-guard 91865
We 91929
remained 92014
upon 92233
the 92249
crest 92265
of 92274
the 92317
hill 92418
till 92456
half-past 92529

the 92608
men 92934
being 92942
formed 93060
in 93171
line 93184
of 93208
battle 93352
and 93422
directed 93590
to 93685
lie 93695
down 93745
till 93848
the 93985
time 94079
for 94258
them 94451
to 94605
march 95242
Our 95348
sentinels 95370
had 95667
been 95676
posted 95687
with 95875
extra 95922
precaution 95955
so 96169
that 96806
they 96937
might 96988
be 97342
withdrawn 97453
an 97465
hour 97556
or 97559
two 97614
after 98067
the 98174
brigade 98566
should 98592
move 98705
Extra 98708
reserves 99137
were 99448
assigned 99484
to 99520
them 99530
and 99544
Major 99559
Hines 99621
put 99767
in 99904
command 100035
of 100056
the 100100
whole 100145
detachment 101240
with 101260
orders 101375
to 101437
keep 101524
in 101702
communication 101735
with 101747
me 101786
at 101903
the 101911
extreme 101929
rear 101988
of 102305
the 102549
marching 102623
column 102810
It 103167
was 103228
interesting 103342
to 103518
observe 103647
the 104096
effect 104284
of 104297
this 104337
night 104364
movement 104903
upon 105184
the 105615
men 105735
Their 105760
imagination 105989
was 106107
excited 106121
by 106191
the 106196
novelty 106220
of 106412
the 106549
situation 106690
and 106764
they 106855
furnished 106862
abundant 107108
evidence 107386
that 107572
the 107717
unknown 107786
is 108030
always 108356
in 108384
such 108813
cases 108835
the 108888
wonderful 108905
The 109158
night 109297
had 109385
cleared 109395
off 109483
and 109539
the 109562
stars 109573
were 109935
out 110046
The 110210
Confederate 110431
position 110599
was 110677
eastward 110749
from 110789
us 111040
and 111226
as 111303
a 111352
bright 111355
star 111405
rose 111524
above 111611
the 111626
ridge 111628
on 111848
which 112093
the 112123
enemy 112352
was 112527
we 112558
could 112681
hear 112787
soldiers 112851
saying 112964
in 113094
a 113166
low 113222
tone 113417
to 113518
each 113528
other 113565
There 113571
goes 113694
a 113700
fire 113802
balloon--it 113893
must 113931
be 113959
a 114110
signal--they 114148
must 114269
have 114396
discovered 114465
what 114496
we 114640
are 114767
doing 114911
The 115020
exaggerated 115165
parallax 115215
at 115480
the 115601
horizon 115727
made 116037
the 116050
rising 116259
star 116269
seem 116776
to 116946
move 117011
rapidly 117015
for 117179
the 117555
first 117622
few 117648
minutes 117851
and 117872
men 117905
ignorant 118054
of 118247
this 118376
naturally 118519
mistook 118526
its 118632
character 118747
In 118837
a 119160
similar 119301
way 119523
an 119888
occasional 120161
shot 120290
on 120445
the 120494
picket 120632
line 120889
would 121023
be 121235
the 121249
cause 121638
of 121708
a 121865
subdued 122033
excitement 122089
I 122424
doubt 122651
if 122674
soldiers 122805
ever 123073
make 123185
a 123266
night 123327
movement 123812
in 123898
an 123981
enemy's 123992
presence 124194
without 124297
being 124300
under 124320
a 124526
nervous 124529
strain 124707
which 124783
exaggerates 125322
the 125347
importance 125411
of 125479
everything 125701
they 126145
see 126172
and 126503
hear 126901
and 127016
this 127079
gives 127116
uncertainty 127166
and 127188
increases 127564
the 127652
difficulty 127694
of 127840
such 127936
duty 127957
It 128230
is 128294
no 128522
small 128650
part 128688
of 128703
the 128909
duty 128961
of 128964
officers 129037
in 129175
such 129288
cases 129633
to 129713
allay 129740
this 130209
tendency 130696
to 130707
excitement 130730
to 130750
explain 130778
the 130782
situation 130795
and 130922
by 130988
a 130999
wise 131064
mixture 131072
of 131214
information 131389
and 131434
discipline 131580
to 131598
keep 131610
the 131614
men 131692
intelligently 131703
cool 131769
and 131964
in 132054
full 132056
command 132099
of 132125
their 132130
faculties 132292
General 132461
Rosecrans 132643
had 132659
gone 132765
with 132788
the 132815
head 132821
of 133065
the 133272
column 133317
and 133380
had 133572
left 133647
with 133794
me 134204
Major 134414
Slemmer 134469
his 134533
inspector-general 134562
to 134730
bring 134793
him 134831
word 134903
when 135230
the 135334
rear 135370
of 135485
the 135501
column 135515
should 135745
be 135901
in 135918
march 136090
Slemmer 136111
was 136318
the 136347
officer 136395
who 136437
as 136526
a 136539
lieutenant 136587
had 136618
distinguished 136711
himself 136714
by 136750
holding 136792
Fort 137073
Pickens 137099
in 137217
Pensacola 137447
harbor 137471
at 137493
the 137604
outbreak 137715
of 137720
the 137835
rebellion 137862
He 137933
was 137985
a 138440
man 138467
of 138477
marked 138779
character 138789
and 138874
in 138940
view 138994
of 139094
his 139371
experience 139379
it 139466
may 139486
easily 140519
be 140549
understood 140582
that 140952
we 140954
had 141079
no 141266
lack 141524
of 142171
interesting 142248
matter 142279
for 142396
conversation 142987
as 142989
we 143049
paced 143303
in 143351
rear 144093
of 144515
the 144581
reclining 144586
men 144629
during 144873
the 144911
midnight 145012
hours 145031
His 145359
failing 145822
health 145837
prevented 146047
his 146183
taking 146627
the 146943
prominent 147325
part 147542
in 147607
the 147668
war 147692
that 147699
his 147728
abilities 147864
warranted 147878
but 147890
I 148329
have 148407
retained 148526
from 148575
that 148582
evening's 148970
work 148987
together 149091
a 149344
pleasing 149532
impression 149602
of 149773
his 149866
character 149988
and 150003
a 150326
respect 150332
for 150424
his 150810
military 150895
knowledge 151176
and 151273
talents 151285
In 151718
impressing 151911
on 152176
me 152190
the 152203
fact 152877
that 152971
my 153037
position 153103
was 153163
the 153422
one 153520
of 153805
special 153814
honor 154497
in 154647
this 154728
movement 155460
he 155619
expressed 155762
the 156252
wish 156434
that 156471
Rosecrans 156855
had 156995
himself 157217
remained 157395
there 157489
but 157512
the 157761
result 157772
showed 157803
that 157873
hardly 158160
less 158420
than 158487
the 158835
commanding 158977
general's 158999
own 159005
authority 159115
and 159131
energy 159182
could 159279
have 159558
got 159699
the 160077
column 160226
forward 160265
in 160278
the 160471
mud 160806
and 160941
darkness 160992
The 161201
troops 161335
had 161355
marched 162151
but 162185
a 162257
mile 162337
or 162412
two 162494
when 162611
they 162628
overtook 162881
part 162934
of 162937
the 163085
wagon 163368
train 163379
toiling 163428
slowly 163671
over 163777
the 163795
steep 164129
and 164151
slippery 164782
hills 165000
Here 165009
and 165058
there 165151
a 165167
team 165350
would 165558
be 165778
stalled 165781
in 165878
the 166370
mud 166438
and 166565
it 166568
looked 166674
as 166733
if 166737
daylight 166744
would 166788
overtake 166792
us 166875
before 166884
even 166907
a 166936
tolerably 167008
defensive 167141
position 167196
would 167271
be 167292
reached 167419
Rosecrans 167431
now 167543
gave 167616
his 167922
personal 167941
supervision 167956
to 167994
the 168122
moving 168248
of 168535
the 168602
wagons 168649
and 168895
artillery 168900
--wagon-master's 168968
work 168986
it 169162
maybe 169443
said 169573
but 169577
it 169672
was 169756
work 169782
which 170056
had 170175
to 170214
be 170356
done 170420
if 170472
the 170547
little 170904
army 170915
was 170970
not 171292
to 171334
be 171715
found 171869
in 171892
the 172094
morning 172581
strung 172949
out 173153
and 173157
exposed 173163
to 173177
the 173477
blows 173506
of 173610
the 173618
enemy 173856
if 173896
he 173934
should 174010
prove 174123
enterprising 174162
We 174190
who 174438
were 174810
at 174821
the 174826
rear 174854
did 175239
not 175431
know 175612
of 175660
the 175724
difficulty 175923
the 176078
column 176256
was 176385
having 176497
and 176563
when 176573
my 176682
messenger 176701
reported 176784
the 177025
rear 177432
of 177435
the 177465
preceding 177481
brigade 177510
a 177549
mile 177664
or 177677
more 177694
from 177699
the 177965
camp 177983
I 178140
gave 178164
the 178240
order 178247
to 178414
march 178432
and 178609
my 178707
men 178801
filed 178934
into 179045
the 179066
road 179159
Slemmer 179163
went 179247
forward 179415
to 179499
inform 179507
the 179537
general 180032
that 180039
we 180319
were 180660
in 180689
movement 180759
and 180822
I 180907
remained 181020
with 181107
Major 181232
Hines 181635
till 181841
all 181960
was 182242
quiet 182468
when 182831
he 183405
was 183438
directed 183607
to 183760
call 183965
in 184885
his 184945
pickets 184981
and 185002
sentinels 185025
and 185033
follow 185407
I 9184
had 10744
gone 176455
hardly 9534
a 64182
mile 80697
when 10423
we 91902
were 57569
brought 16292
to 61309
a 82110
halt 87058
by 88805
the 90561
head 108645
of 121136
the 129509
brigade 137299
overtaking 168769
those 172818
who 172900
had 183226
preceded 6727
us 52555
Word 120358
was 1053
brought 16891
back 19159
that 19209
the 19230
artillery 19358
was 19876
finding 19905
great 19938
difficulty 24238
in 25239
getting 29128
over 32615
the 33655
first 33779
considerable 33799
hill 35342
west 35427
of 35469
the 35528
mountain 35662
We 36723
ourselves 37256
were 37623
upon 37668
the 40485
downward 45079
road 45711
from 49072
the 49508
mountain 56451
crest 68994
but 69011
our 70805
way 71598
led 72116
along 72894
the 73194
side 73528
of 74372
a 79167
spur 81323
of 83183
the 92296
mountain 93555
which 94687
towered 94901
above 95183
us 96522
on 97691
our 97849
left 99267
We 99519
were 100042
in 102529
a 102678
dense 102703
wood 102795
that 102819
shut 102896
out 102923
the 102963
stars 102979
and 103006
in 103071
darkness 103192
that 103213
could 103239
almost 103272
be 104645
felt 104990
I 105816
rode 106327
back 107069
a 107466
little 108194
to 109924
meet 110038
Hines 110521
and 110624
to 111835
keep 112088
some 112264
distance 112288
between 112456
the 112753
column 112782
and 112850
his 112999
little 113012
rear-guard 113411
We 113561
sent 114256
a 114403
chain 114464
of 114688
sentinels 115819
over 116870
the 117935
hill 118485
commanding 119115
the 130335
road 131896
and 137501
waited 159302
listening 160073
for 164148
any 166493
evidence 166548
that 166986
the 177591
enemy 177947
had 178394
discovered 180618
our 182001
movement 2013
and 3233
followed 111376
An 175968
hour 13554
passed 25026
in 25874
this 33359
way 33475
and 33915
the 34109
column 44442
moved 45052
on 48882
a 68876
short 71781
distance 72212
Again 72373
there 73102
was 74738
a 78010
halt 82989
and 90506
again 95845
a 99438
deployment 108703
of 125380
our 131767
sentries 155537
When 162282
at 168129
last 168160
day 178704
broke 181373
we 21696
were 26948
only 34778
three 73550
or 95918
four 106387
miles 115043
from 118318
our 114766
camp 118416
of 181771
the 3038
evening 163433
before 44344
but 29849
we 48290
had 160308
reached 30708
a 4194
position 19393
which 20821
was 31357
easily 33772
defensible 41055
and 41405
where 43809
I 46451
could 46554
halt 47601
the 50405
brigade 65819
and 72094
wait 120097
for 136732
the 166058
others 4345
to 18064
get 21136
entirely 35665
out 55224
of 55646
our 73734
way 79103
The 91504
men 108019
boiled 116886
their 138647
coffee 154970
cooked 158859
their 155828
breakfast 163241
and 54467
rested 120240
Early 159442
in 177442
the 45527
forenoon 26564
a 141198
small 3659
body 12371
of 44811
the 122660
enemy's 151656
cavalry 19423
followed 22315
us 26828
but 36052
were 42431
contented 50631
with 56401
very 56557
slight 66572
skirmishing 67654
and 69184
we 84773
marched 97973
leisurely 98872
to 100841
Camp 110633
Lookout 111330
before 113473
evening 119179
Such 120321
night 120560
marches 121403
from 121715
the 133449
presence 139165
of 140817
an 141127
enemy 145644
are 146643
among 146730
the 146843
most 148411
wearing 150104
and 152738
trying 158865
in 160640
the 165899
soldier's 168981
experience 178784
yet 181833
in 182054
spite 82004
of 80679
the 56505
temptation 115647
to 129902
invest 60409
them 853
with 2134
extraordinary 4100
peril 16213
they 52528
are 52823
rarely 70464
interfered 74905
with 82444
It 118823
is 119616
the 120808
uncertainty 120882
the 143338
darkness 156222
and 42429
the 36050
effect 88992
of 100838
these 118990
upon 145642
men 168979
and 110631
officers 152735
that 6734
make 38955
the 39165
duty 82031
a 151102
delicate 85322
one 88321
The 89139
risk 120885
is 133849
more 134080
from 165761
panic 124157
than 64387
from 64399
the 162569
foe 79327
and 84015
the 135270
loss 169894
is 46460
more 63770
likely 83113
to 84506
be 84536
in 126060
baggage 139447
and 93375
in 619
wagons 91148
than 99153
in 153187
men 112926
I 140763
have 61962
several 23331
times 39057
been 53156
in 53219
command 121482
of 121518
rear-guards 121581
on 121675
such 139153
occasions 139819
and 141894
I 142019
believe 145934
that 146647
I 148932
would 149315
generally 151284
prefer 151982
an 154074
open 159557
withdrawal 161467
by 165157
day 168760
It 170227
is 178246
not 2659
hard 147708
to 2760
hold 152794
even 121492
a 4843
bold 11128
enemy 13835
at 17509
bay 28047
by 40132
a 41325
determined 43038
brigade 47084
or 54490
division 55446
and 62459
a 76094
whole 78098
army 79716
may 81140
be 87635
saved 87793
from 88006
the 88504
exhaustion 104474
and 121165
exposure 124729
which 125831
rapidly 129592
fill 133151
the 135708
hospitals 139306
and 140867
may 143436
cost 151047

alive 23256

the 30032
opportunity 30159

comparing 36843

cure 172979
defects 182321
in 11612
my 38316
own 39571

was 71030
gratified 71042
to 71114
see 71179
in 24340
my 61959
troops 63348
evidence 77182
of 133488
a 145323
pride 146218
in 160722
their 172503
own 8420
organization 169833

a 97369
wholesome 64411
emulation 10906
which 59981
made 61692
them 61777
take 61832
kindly 100590

the 106823
drill 107729

discipline 67226
which 67336
were 139210
necessary 18701

improvement 38911
I 50924
was 50979
particularly 51001
interested 66290
in 69259
observing 69265
Rosecrans's 69363

His 78774
standard 85427
of 94372
soldierly 94706
excellence 95974
was 97699
high 97937
and 101647
he 102268
was 102729
earnest 104951
in 105327
insisting 105393

his 109953
brigadiers 110562

his 112691
staff 113930
officers 114064
should 114283
co-operate 115087
vigorously 115770
in 116298
trying 128973
to 137740
attain 172905
it 19534
His 22002
impulsiveness 22503
however 22520
led 32941
him 37547
sometimes 44943
into 45297
personal 45774
efforts 47045
at 47277
discipline 47842
where 48619
the 48750
results 48847
were 48903
at 50990
least 69367
doubtful 69370
He 69373
would 69755
sometimes 69803
go 69824
out 76744

the 91543
camps 94426
in 94797

saw 95683

lighted 96210
after 97350

heard 97591
men 97959
singing 100933

The 21166

good-humored 40081
mischief 42389
would 42562
try 52096
different 57293
ways 57353

getting 64326
even 64372

him 73572

them 100561

with 113164
the 113178
most 113479
innocent 114219
astonishment 116378

explained 117115
that 117594

in 120219
the 122546
habit 122611
of 124913
annoying 124956
them 125966

I 147562
have 147576
been 151326
with 152669
the 159712
general 160064
in 160221
approaching 160517
a 160612
picket 161309
when 161928
he 161973
would 162694
hotly 168834
lecture 177745
a 177968
sentinel 178025
who 178079
showed 178106
ignorance 178156
of 178285
some 179136
of 179368
his 179912
duties 180774
or 181793
inattention 181985
to 1754
them 88643
I 2017
thought 111380
I 1813
could 99581
see 1556
in 73849
all 1889
such 104842
cases 118053
that 127449
it 135836
would 121787
have 81126
been 63594
wiser 64251
to 64274
avoid 64281
any 85442
unnecessary 118774
collision 126620
with 142333
the 26689
privates 35708
but 43621
to 79412
take 109540
the 131704
responsible 132055
officer 167420
aside 167781
and 14511
make 91949
him 95382
privately 105165
understand 111023
that 160993
he 176445
must 316
answer 354
for 737
such 3312
lack 3440
of 3484
instruction 3503
or 3519
of 3652
discipline 3738
among 4092
his 4187
men 4287
An 4499
impulsive 4704
man 4815
is 4821
too 4845
apt 4898
to 4975
meddle 5236
with 5258
details 5293
and 5409
so 5557
to 5567
weaken 5783
the 5852
sense 6136
of 6166
responsibility 6238
in 6462
the 6478
intermediate 6715
officers 6747
who 6752
hate 6774
to 6789
be 6806
ignored 6929
or 6942
belittled 6947
before 6966
the 6983
soldiers 6998
But 7156
if 7263
Rosecrans's 7293
method 7379
was 7386
not 7395
an 7418
ideal 7435
one 7442
it 7455
was 7535
at 7562
least 7910
vigorous 8164

every 8185
week 8197
showed 8294
that 8789
the 8802
little 8852
army 8972
was 9162
improving 9585
in 9762
discipline 10134
and 10438
in 10488
knowledge 10497
of 11020

On 25837
the 25896
1st 26000
of 26192
November 26581
the 27028
early 27231
morning 27489
was 27559
fair 27613
but 27788
misty 27855
and 27989
a 28019
fog 28026
lay 28044
in 28056
the 28235
gorge 29427
of 29499
New 29539
River 29830
nearly 29890
a 30700
thousand 31285
feet 31586
below 31805
the 31887
little 31946
plateau 32561
at 32878
the 32898
Tompkins 32979
farm 33409
on 33781
which 34123
the 34472
headquarters 35151
tents 35198
were 35650
pitched 35788
General 35907
Rosecrans's 35916
tents 36106
were 36118
not 36201
more 36299
than 36796
a 37614
hundred 37664
yards 37701
above 37950
mine 37962
between 38031
the 38164
turnpike 38190
and 38252
the 38384
steep 38566
descent 38759
to 38894
the 39082
river 40083
though 40113
both 40246
our 40300
little 40368
camps 40433
were 40511
secluded 40579
by 40894
thickets 41313
of 42041
young 42139
trees 42587
and 42718
laurel 42768
bushes 42890
Breakfast 42933
was 43083
over 43104
the 43132
fog 43141
was 43338
lifting 43576
out 43633
of 43710
the 43874
valley 44040
and 44078
I 44614
was 45019
attending 45051
to 45191
the 45640
usual 45648
morning 45663
routine 46031
of 46086
clerical 47062
work 47549
when 47672
the 47875
report 47975
and 48063
echo 48383
of 48434
a 48540
cannon-shot 48553
down 48929
the 48939
gorge 48964
in 49029
the 49068
direction 49505
of 49862
Gauley 49929
Bridge 50038
was 50809
heard 50885
It 51018
was 51028
unusual 51557
enough 51633
so 51708
to 51872
set 52628
me 52771
thinking 53039
what 53061
it 53292
could 54070
mean 54183
but 54377
the 54482
natural 54606
explanation 54633
suggested 54697
itself 55837
that 55912
it 55959
was 56011
one 56317
of 56433
our 56485
own 56488
guns 56931
perhaps 57213
fired 57224
at 57308
a 57430
target 57462
In 57469
a 57730
few 57752
moments 57791
an 57815
orderly 57863
came 57971
in 57998
some 58025
haste 58035
saying 58046
the 58084
general 58129
desired 58233
to 58348
see 58507
me 58604
at 58639
his 58701
tent 58744
As 58864
I 58867
walked 59094
over 59316
to 59340
his 59551
quarters 59608
another 59715
shot 59732
was 60249
heard 60404
As 60446
I 60449
approached 60609
I 60639
saw 60727
him 60969
standing 61086
in 61231
front 61543
of 61657
his 61915
tent 61977
door 62323
evidently 62799
much 62818
excited 63022
and 63045
when 63090
I 63123
came 63150
up 63256
to 63521
him 63555
he 63682
said 63694
in 63700
the 64093
rapid 64567
half-stammering 64826
way 65000
peculiar 65117
to 65176
him 65280
at 65287
such 65386
times 65469
The 65596
enemy 65902
has 65948
got 65984
a 66002
battery 66012
on 66077
Cotton 66205
Mountain 66316
opposite 66325
our 66345
post 66352
and 66397
is 66417
shelling 67428
it 67436
What 67454
d' 67523
ye 67531
think 67660
of 67969
that 67993
The 68044
post 68074
at 68350
the 68359
bridge 68405
and 68601
his 68647
headquarters 68791
were 69454
connected 69707
by 69718
telegraph 70163
and 70245
the 70496
operator 70650
below 70799
had 71512
reported 71618
the 71689
fact 71864
of 72146
the 72248
opening 72725
of 72758
the 72884
cannonade 73048
from 73407
the 73448
mountain 73896
side 74464
above 74855
him 75163
and 75180
added 75790
that 75812
his 75994
office 76184
was 76288
so 76432
directly 77450
under 77751
fire 77892
that 77955
he 78053
must 78078
move 78452
out 79366
of 79383
it 79906
Indeed 79989
he 80742
was 80825
gone 80881
and 81169
communication 81196
broken 81208
before 81370
orders 81691
could 81761
be 81918
sent 82116
to 82157
him 82176
or 82243
to 82367
the 82523
post 82582
The 82888
fact 82988
of 83519
the 83643
cannonade 83713
did 83722
not 83828
disturb 83845
me 84032
so 84101
much 84342
as 84356
the 84370
way 84593
in 84688
which 85165
it 85482
affected 85816
Rosecrans 85859
He 86097
had 86234
been 86396
expecting 86426
to 86437
be 86446
attacked 86837
by 86904
Lee 86963
in 87035
front 87045
and 87056
knew 87064
that 87074
McCook 87171
was 87204
exchanging 87390
shots 87422
across 87499
the 87581
river 87588
with 87651
some 87710
force 88030
of 88048
the 88154
enemy 88158
at 88201
Miller's 88706
Ferry 88718
but 89417
that 89651
the 89706
attack 89901
should 89986
come 90505
two 90526
miles 90741
or 90760
more 91011
in 91033
our 91075
rear 91144
from 91407
a 91847
point 92166
where 92398
artillery 93694
had 93768
a 93809
plunging 93831
fire 93841
directly 94244
into 94365
our 94527
depot 94575
of 94584
supplies 94589
and 94682
commanded 94744
our 95023
only 95504
road 96384
for 96410
a 96591
half-mile 98245
where 98252
it 98738
ran 98756
on 98797
a 98826
narrow 98919
bench 98968
along 100060
New 100127
River 100240
under 100816
Gauley 101105
Mountain 101998
cliffs 102126
had 102410
been 102424
so 102526
startling 102618
as 102770
to 102881
throw 103141
him 103199
decidedly 103232
off 103241
his 103255
balance 103361
The 103402
error 103447
in 103572
not 104511
occupying 104609
Cotton 104706
Mountain 104957
himself 105033
was 105194
now 105284
not 105289
only 105584
made 105733
plain 106843
but 106973
the 107085
consequences 107212
were 107431
not 107743
pleasant 108342
to 108798
contemplate 108876
I 108884
saw 109255
that 109683
the 111299
best 111566
service 111685
I 112208
could 112278
render 112491
him 112808
for 112915
the 113415
moment 114107
was 114125
to 114136
help 114319
him 114381
back 114479
into 115725
a 115856
frame 115876
of 115893
mind 115904
in 116004
which 116176
cool 116735
reasoning 116961
on 117319
the 117325
situation 117523
would 117773
be 117841
possible 118000
I 118029
have 118062
already 118370
stated 118564
the 119110
contrast 119196
between 119570
my 119662
own 119882
sense 120021
of 120052
care 120090
when 120142
in 120308
sole 120506
command 120769
and 120861
the 120951
comparative 120999
freedom 121135
from 121191
it 121259
when 121273
a 121522
senior 121549
officer 121568
came 121574
upon 121612
the 121699
field 121762
and 121801
I 122130
now 122237
realized 122247
how 122393
much 122462
easier 122671
it 123011
was 123238
for 123250
a 123293
subordinate 123322
to 123334
take 123457
things 123563
coolly 123638
I 123896
therefore 124012
purposely 124605
entered 124644
into 124754
a 124995
discussion 125013
of 125153
the 125214
probabilities 125399
of 125516
the 125628
situation 125739
and 125765
drew 125793
it 126229
out 126465
at 126514
length 127102
enough 127241
to 127431
assist 127783
the 128083
general 128127
in 128309
recovering 128352
full 128355
control 128367
of 128437
himself 128602
and 128609
of 128828
his 128852
own 128870
faculties 128956
We 129135
could 129402
not 129430
from 129524
where 129567
we 129781
stood 130053
see 130184
the 130445
post 130716
at 131183
Gauley 131279
Bridge 131315
nor 131719
even 131728
the 133424
place 133539
on 133671
Cotton 133835
Mountain 133856
where 133875
the 133913
enemy's 133986
battery 134130
was 134150
placed 134516
and 134598
we 134728
walked 134737
a 134761
little 134777
way 134849
apart 135102
from 135468
our 135881
staff 136313
officers 136345
to 136407
a 136418
position 136595
from 137106
which 137197
we 137233
could 137258
see 137267
the 137320
occasional 137657
puffs 138045
of 138061
white 138150
smoke 138291
from 138606
the 138646
hostile 138665
guns 138770
From 138838
our 138986
camp 139047
the 139060
road 139090
descended 139111
sharply 139263
along 139663
the 139869
shoulders 139931
of 139951
steep 140125
hills 140324
covered 140532
with 140781
wood 140842
for 141018
a 141033
mile 141197
and 141276
a 141452
half 141697
till 142013
it 142179
reached 142233
the 142394
bottom 142503
of 142733
the 142877
New 142952
River 143069
gorge 143122
and 143327
then 143471
it 143763
followed 143766
the 143853
open 143858
bench 144019
I 144057
have 144085
mentioned 144111
till 144171
it 144226
reached 144253
the 144350
crossing 144425
of 144639
the 144725
Gauley 144829

not 149015

for 157652

having 158302
as 158569

The 160066
Confederates 160378

that 162105
he 162252
violated 162452
his 162488
obligation 162527
in 162635
escaping 162713
We 162783
had 162795
no 162804

verifying 162845
the 163029
facts 163167
in 163314
the 163512

His 164524

was 164653

there 166560
but 166693
in 166801
his 167093
characteristic 167129
light-headed 167538
way 167682
instead 167699
of 167776
taking 167982
steps 168805
to 168871
protect 168913
his 170213
post 170240
and 170388
re-establish 170402
the 170999
telegraph 171068

he 171353
had 171465
dashed 171596
off 171676
to 171679
report 171689
in 171784
person 171840
at 171919
headquarters 172019
As 172292
he 172366
was 172802
willing 173350
to 173404
take 173409
the 173415
risks 174046
of 174058
the 174071
race 174112
back 174146
again 174399
he 174465
was 174476
allowed 174533
to 174540
go 174557
after 174562
being 174734
fully 174799
instructed 174949

set 175060
up 175177

out 177270
of 177669
danger 177681
as 177955
soon 177990
as 177996
he 178018
should 178051
be 178243
over 178262

prepare 178312
the 178603

at 181006

I 181785
begged 182237
the 182282
general 182331
to 182541
be 182555
allowed 182600
to 182683
go 182735
back 182939
with 182979
De 182996
Villiers 183475
as 183588
the 183927
thing 183951
I 184216
most 184259
feared 184616
was 185023
some 185094
panic 185339
at 130463
the 5426
post 39718
which 54279
might 106139
result 128369
in 141587
the 178250
destruction 70125
of 130660
our 82651
stores 151597
in 2281
depot 8037
there 21390
He 21498
however 28936
insisted 31511
on 57193
my 69956
staying 125573
at 126135

Benham 30788

was 163756
also 166754
ordered 173265
to 177341
report 180181
at 180452

the 9409
intention 11222

the 98799

An 130881
hour 132607
or 141930
two 142780
passed 153136
and 156176
the 156193
detachment 161522
from 161670
Benham's 161900
brigade 162055
approached 170327
It 184786
was 45957
the 10594
Thirteenth 17531
Ohio 20394
led 25572
by 38343
one 40018
of 41255
its 42190
field 42460
officers 48477
who 52561
halted 61699
the 62207
column 75255
and 80437
rode 85970
up 86280
to 89449
General 91820
Rosecrans 101775
for 103048
orders 105664
The 119682
general's 123661
manner 127796
was 137572
still 141566
an 145130
excited 147611
one 149408
and 153492
in 164118
the 179543
rapidity 29255
with 31266
which 129710
his 173947
directions 9680
were 10686
given 24395
the 30597
officer 50144
did 84125
not 158166
seem 10306
to 10469
get 30212
a 41635
clear 42222
idea 151175
of 90784
what 4551
was 29460
required 90576
of 182223
him 157839
He 140995
made 172
some 548
effort 635
to 643
get 3658
the 4148
orders 4383
explained 4559
but 5594
his 5628
failure 5646
to 5669
comprehend 5719
seemed 5769
to 5845
irritate 5988
Rosecrans 6251
and 6258
he 6283
therefore 6294
bowed 6318
and 6336
rode 6633
back 7120
to 7672
his 7756
men 7840
with 8712
a 8861
blank 8880
look 9031
which 9048
did 9063
not 10463
promise 11819
well 12162
for 12280
intelligent 12458
action 13588
Noticing 13611
this 13816
I 14011
quietly 14096
walked 14119
aside 14134
among 14282
the 14450
bushes 14489
and 14558
when 14577
out 15182
of 15626
sight 15763
hurried 15771
a 15789
little 15840
in 15849
advance 15866
and 15884
waited 15896
at 16037
the 16098
roadside 16140
for 16150
the 16314
column 16398
I 16432
beckoned 16479
the 16514
officer 16705
to 16982
me 17276
and 17558
said 18160
to 18615
him 19137
Colonel 19697
I 19818
thought 19865
you 19900
looked 19913
as 21225
if 21467
you 21667
did 21701
not 21706
fully 21717
understand 22294
the 22584
general's 22637
wishes 22732
He 22867
replied 22941
that 23184
he 23612
did 23921
not 24017
but 24412
was 24443
unwilling 24817
to 25268
question 25597
him 25755
as 26171
it 26985
seemed 27079
to 27700
irritate 27770
him 27879
I 28195
said 28201
that 28219
was 28633
a 28705
wrong 28724
principle 28874
to 28909
act 29510
on 29718
as 29809
a 29848
commanding 29868
officer 30182
has 30276
the 30557
greatest 30611
possible 30749
interest 30892
in 31075
being 31435
clearly 31460
understood 31834
I 32093
then 32413
explained 32553
at 33282
large 33391
what 34563
I 34834
knew 35344
to 35730
be 35795
Rosecrans's 35807
purposes 35890
The 36324
officer 36341
thanked 36351
me 36558
cordially 36954
and 37631
rode 37646
away 37675
I 37679
have 38091
ventured 38442
to 38641
give 38648
this 38715
incident 38865
with 38937
such 39325
fulness 40439
because 40477
subsequent 40647
events 40691
in 41173
Rosecrans's 41264
career 41344
strengthened 41366
the 41441
impression 42209
I 42395
formed 42578
at 43589
the 44212
time 44512
that 44552
the 45048
excitability 45127
of 45425
his 45430
temperament 45521
was 46306
such 46448
that 46795
an 46837
unexpected 46908
occurrence 46947
might 47583
upset 47777
his 48508
judgment 49273
so 49474
that 49660
it 49890
would 49905
be 49934
uncertain 49980
how 50031
he 50053
would 50235
act 51108
--whether 51146
it 51184
would 51523
rouse 51902
him 52217
to 53307
a 54204
heroism 54517
of 54806
which 55028
he 55383
was 55480
quite 55578
capable 55676
or 55714
make 55723
him 55732
for 56259
the 57080
time 57109
unfit 57132
for 57169
real 57314
leadership 57376
by 57466
suspending 57719
his 57774
self-command 57780

the 70171

soon 91974
came 92082
to 92243
the 92441
slashing 92665
which 93324
I 93350
had 93571
made 93691
in 93706
August 93827
to 94098
prevent 94217
the 94471
enemy's 94481
easy 95072
approach 95148
to 95762
the 95779
river 96034
near 96250
the 97046
post 97290
The 97632
mist 97946
of 98367
the 98425
morning 98462
had 98667
changed 98701
to 98996
a 99132
drizzling 99183
rain 99455
We 99912
had 99926
on 99943
our 99993
heavy 100432
horsemen's 100536
overcoats 101695
with 101745
large 101757
capes 101902
cavalry 102027
boots 102071
and 102637
spurs 102649
swords 103320
and 103391
pistols 103714
This 103816
made 104130
it 104157
toilsome 104237
work 104291
for 104625
us 104636
The 104648
trees 104656
had 104678
been 105594
felled 106013
so 106023
that 106595
they 106832
crossed 106910
each 106991
other 107135
in 107338
utmost 107539
confusion 108181
on 108290
the 108444
steep 108515
declivity 108540
Many 108575
of 108727
them 108945
were 109216
very 109425
large 109536
and 109784
we 110696
slid 110707
over 110725
the 110743
great 110759
wet 110918
trunks 110924
climbed 110936
through 110952
and 110968
under 111147
branches 111499
let 111555
ourselves 111609
down 111746
walls 111963
of 112131
natural 112396
rock 112701
tripped 112981
and 113233
hampered 113249
by 113459
our 113476
accoutrements 114449
till 114558
we 114608
came 114636
to 115231
the 115365
end 115509
of 115540
the 115560
entanglement 115570
at 115633
what 115846
we 116079
supposed 116155
was 116553
the 116575
edge 116852
of 117464
the 117513
river 117610
To 117632
our 117657
dismay 117736
we 117930
found 118200
that 118211
we 118307
had 118323
not 118342
kept 118418
up 118496
stream 118586
far 118619
enough 119209
and 119230
that 119241
at 119290
this 119752
point 120151
was 120498
a 120649
sheer 120893
precipice 121364
some 121741
thirty 121780
feet 122379
high 122573
We 122928
could 123351
find 123440
no 123710
crevices 124031
to 124081
help 125727
us 126143
climb 126150
down 126219
it 126584
We 127186
tried 127382
to 127628
work 127833
along 127902
the 128425
edge 128431
till 128897
we 128986
should 129266
reach 129368
a 130190
lower 130258
place 130297
but 130549
this 131166
utterly 131206
failed 131552
We 132827
were 132979
obliged 133014
to 133137
retrace 133147
our 133315
steps 133605
to 133788
the 134608
open 134638
wood 134684
above 134703
the 134857
slashing 134892
But 134946
if 135150
the 135397
downward 135513
climbing 136084
had 136199
been 136737
hard 136806
this 136843
attempt 136986
to 136999
pull 137044
ourselves 137087
up 137524
again 138234
superasque 138261
evadere 138748
ad 138865
auras 138980
was 139023
labor 140592
indeed 141009
We 141205
stopped 141221
several 141348
times 141781
from 142098
sheer 142135
exhaustion 143484
so 143522
blown 143572
that 143776
it 143895
seemed 144121
almost 144219
impossible 144298
to 144654
get 144962
breath 144967
again 144987
Our 145084
clothes 145113
were 145297
heavy 145441
from 145769
the 145778
rain 146129
on 146575
the 146742
outside 146798
and 147275
wet 147523
with 147547
perspiration 147615
on 147845
the 147903
inside 148442
At 148456
last 148544
however 148645
we 148707
accomplished 148744
it 148797
and 148831
resting 149454
for 149767
a 149997
while 150025
at 150231
the 150321
foot 150360
of 150839
a 150892
great 150967
tree 151299
till 151355
we 151612
gained 152864
a 153557
little 154292
strength 154296
we 154639
followed 154645
the 154755
upper 155425
line 155465
of 155798
the 155868
slashing 156265
till 156566
we 156991
passed 157291
beyond 157325
it 157626
and 158934
then 159568
turned 159688
toward 159767
the 160230
river 160268
choosing 160295
to 160773
reach 160781
its 160793
banks 161445
high 161517
up 161679
above 161898
the 162562
camp 162877
rather 163057
than 163248
attempt 163270
again 164296
to 164444
climb 164713
through 164895
the 165293
fallen 165368
timber 165715
Once 166532
at 166576
the 166710
water's 166882
edge 167457
we 167594
followed 168115
the 168229
stream 168646
down 169251
till 169670
we 170361
were 170764
opposite 171116
the 171289
guard 171298
post 171494
above 171551
the 171639
camp 171752
when 171972
we 172252
hailed 172453
for 172518
a 172602
skiff 172620
and 172817
were 172946
ferried 173592
over 174128
It 174215
was 174598
now 175073
almost 175523
dark 175598
but 175813
the 176140
arrangements 176162
were 176476
soon 176638
made 176771
to 176932
have 177103
wagons 177113
ready 177253
at 177406
the 177943
building 177952
on 178346
the 178463
Kanawha 178478
front 178488
used 178971
as 178976
a 179167
magazine 179207
and 179262
to 179355
move 179420
all 179428
our 179719
ammunition 179857
during 180111
the 180389
night 181031
to 181202
the 181210
place 181217
I 23737
had 174518
indicated 408
in 563
the 2727
ravine 5701
of 6137
Scrabble 6822
Creek 8058
which 9155
runs 9275
into 10164
the 10225
Gauley 11064
The 11374
telegraph 11862
station 12023
was 12615
moved 13079
there 14438
and 14799
connection 14922
of 14928
wires 15321
made 17883
We 19179
also 19222
prepared 19935
to 20839
run 22220
the 24007
ferry 24442
industriously 24728
during 25528
the 25885
night 25948
and 26385
to 26600
put 28093
over 28254
the 29026
necessary 29253
trainloads 29490
of 29906
supplies 30547
for 30613
the 34120
troops 35042
above 35089
A 35101
place 35500
was 35895
selected 36998
high 37343
up 37616
on 38656
the 39067
hill 39110
behind 39528
us 40743
where 43097
I 43431
hoped 43498
to 44618
get 45016
up 48966
a 49463
couple 49842
of 52174
Parrott 55331
guns 56265
which 57171
might 57871
silence 58579
the 60151
cannon 62069
of 62975
the 63774
enemy 64224
on 64327
Cotton 65703
Mountain 66493
I 67144
was 67744
naturally 68127
gratified 69359
at 71659
the 72285
expressions 73080
of 73320
relief 73612
and 74997
satisfaction 76238
of 78295
the 78540
officers 78564
of 79146
the 79959
post 82497
to 82559
have 83481
me 84317
in 85263
person 85488
among 86439
them 86746
They 90235
had 90482
already 92963
found 93672
that 93701
the 93912
plunging 94338
fire 94485
from 94893
the 95292
heights 95744
across 96469
the 98293
river 98343
was 99240
not 99383
a 99699
formidable 100629
thing 100668
and 100704
that 100720
little 100836
mischief 101657
would 101678
happen 101759
if 102948
the 103387
men 103627
were 104468
kept 105450
from 106839
assembling 106948
in 107045
bodies 107241
or 107464
large 108087
groups 108392
within 108480
range 108714
of 108730
the 109221
enemy's 110134
cannon 110220
The 110462
fatigues 110505
of 110726
the 111592
day 114616
made 115652
sleep 115859
welcome 115998
as 116160
soon 116616
as 116815
the 120822
most 121303
pressing 123058
duties 123110
had 124179
been 124484
done 124890
and 126165
I 126867
went 127531
early 127571
to 127656
rest 128008
giving 128604
orders 129204
to 130140
the 130356
guard 133206
at 133674
my 134206
quarters 135122
to 136325
call 136827
me 138307
at 139124
peep 139650
of 139787
day 139825
The 142010
weather 142101
cleared 142312
during 142754
the 143669
night 143679
and 144657
when 144953
I 147064
went 148973
out 149994
in 150612
the 152761
morning 153509
to 154757
see 155074
what 155111
progress 155478
had 156545
been 156785
made 157039
in 157359
transferring 157371
the 157453
ammunition 157636
to 160366
a 160947
safe 161765
place 163218
I 163494
was 163629
surprised 164479
to 165299
find 165815
the 166010
train 166466
of 167857
wagons 168275
stopped 168642
in 169973
the 170899
road 174564
along 174600
the 176509
Gauley 178237
in 179591
front 179850
of 181035
the 183292
camp 680
General 170310
Rosecrans's 7248
ordnance 7331
officer 7464
was 8274
of 10556
the 11982
regular 13924
army 14104
but 20038
unfortunately 23521
was 27439
intemperate 28827
He 32510
had 32817
neglected 35099
his 35880
duty 36270
during 37267
the 41882
night 47060
leaving 49799
his 49919
sergeant 50213
to 50249
get 60789
on 60874
without 62906
guidance 62966
or 64265
direction 68955
The 70680
result 76975
was 80563
that 83272
the 86081
ordnance 86629
stores 93729
had 96267
not 96510
been 98079
loaded 103252
upon 109224
the 111633
waiting 116200
wagons 116793
till 119709
nearly 120329
daylight 125911
and 126171
soon 127510
after 129927
turning 134974
out 136361
of 136642
the 137883
Kanawha 139727
road 152966
into 158486
that 164696
of 164836
the 165640
Gauley 167438
the 175561

of 179300
a 119736

near 65136
the 45659
head 53057
of 78922
the 78990
train 158923
balked 169366
and 127486
the 151191
whole 6419
had 11340
been 50972
brought 63099
to 76225
a 86012
standstill 169278
There 170708
was 171733
a 178111
little 218
rise 7646
in 7814
the 8900
road 12954
on 14823
the 15086
hither 21278
side 23395
of 27733
Scrabble 27781
Creek 39564
where 39585
the 47016
track 58126
cutting 58675
through 58791
the 59873
crest 61599
of 62846
a 64876
hillock 65419
was 67796
only 69077
wide 70277
enough 70863
for 74060
a 74450
single 78317
team 81113
and 83345
this 87811
rise 110518
was 113408
of 118634
course 123111
the 127633
place 128024
where 128296
the 150328
balky 154649
animals 158149
stopped 162259
The 170127
line 176697
of 179057
the 183609
road 65555
was 56414
enfiladed 1697
by 3717
the 13661
enemy's 24545
cannon 41219
the 50058
morning 77880
fog 81068
in 86072
the 89041
valley 89827
was 107472
beginning 136819
to 136844
lift 157889
under 159368
the 159527
influence 163053
of 170892
the 171516
rising 172490
sun 172935
and 2854
as 157525
soon 1595
as 80966
the 170312
situation 181951
was 34464
discovered 72669
we 157005
might 12844
reckon 20377
upon 23973
receiving 26210
the 29957
fire 30870
of 30932
the 35819
Cotton 41308
Mountain 41770
battery 46688
The 47954
wagon-drivers 48337
realized 49655
the 51867
danger 60786
of 65025
handling 66797
an 70897
ammunition 70980
train 72318
under 73467
such 84741
circumstances 89822
and 90141
began 90391
to 91671
be 94819
nervous 96954
whilst 100102
the 100515
onlookers 100878
not 101570
connected 102741
with 105482
the 108106
duty 109786
made 114156
haste 115119
to 115786
get 117039
out 117243
of 134948
harm's 137827
way 138012
My 167739
presence 167765
strengthened 169979
the 173058
authority 181149
of 4948
the 5005
quartermaster 6682

steadying 19781
the 21208

enabled 25769
him 26702
to 30485
enforce 30588
promptly 31108
his 32592
orders 34304
He 35477
stopped 35540
the 35701
noisy 38919
efforts 40388
to 40491
make 41163
the 42250
refractory 42557
mules 42789
move 43729
and 43938
sent 45610
in 46019
haste 48121
for 48662
a 48863
fresh 49423
team 51234
As 51750
soon 52941
as 55204
it 55261
came 55629
this 59783
was 61127
put 61446
in 62560
place 67098
of 68941
the 71379
balky 71495
animals 71563
and 71854
at 71893
the 72508
word 73650
of 78384
command 78896
the 79361
train 80028
started 81384
quickly 81821
forward 82720
The 83937
fog 85045
had 87151
thinned 88571
enough 89066
however 90037
to 90044
give 91224
the 92361
enemy 92742
an 93217
inkling 93445
of 93734
what 94817
was 95107
going 95253
on 97490
and 97700
the 100331
rattling 102309
of 103453
the 103769
wagons 104213
on 106441
the 106701
road 109044
completed 109130
the 109509
exposure 110342
Without 115513
warning 116217
a 116307
ball 116349
struck 117116
in 117205
the 118090
road 118192
near 118232
us 119723
and 120259
bounded 122010
over 130605
the 131579
rear 131826
of 134950
the 135236
train 137124
the 137730
report 137818
of 140037
the 141046
cannon 141182
following 141830
instantly 149187
The 149741
drivers 151595
involuntarily 151918
crouched 152033
over 154040
their 154047
mules 155631
and 155872
cracked 158820
their 159595
whips 159724
Another 160002
shot 162155
followed 163539
but 163890
it 164158
was 165820
also 166226
short 166555
and 167083
the 167562
last 171535
wagon 173566
turned 174818
the 174976
shoulder 177052
of 178900
the 179456
hill 181221
into 89033
the 14175
gorge 14295
of 20637
the 32803
creek 101668
as 105777
the 117796
ball 118488
bounded 118506
along 120830
up 121987
the 124583
Gauley 124624
valley 138030
It 161436
was 161525
perhaps 178824
fortunate 182230
for 5046
us 9341
that 14287
solid 39684
shot 42443
instead 43599
of 44445
shrapnel 49855
were 54094
used 54952
but 55183
it 57120
is 61274
not 64331
improbable 65978
that 70462
the 84384
need 90882
of 91090
haste 98874
in 100121
firing 114385
made 129527
the 140332
battery 146053
officer 155086
feel 160286
that 160770
he 171194
had 3645
no 9411
time 19390
to 21672
cut 24123
and 24147
adjust 31230
fuses 33571
to 40662
the 80708
estimated 82113
distance 82154
to 85580
our 86040
train 87497
or 92280
it 99929
is 104985
possible 107208
that 121140
shells 121180
were 122126
used 123547
but 123963
did 129779
not 139999
explode 143700
It 148029
was 156212
my 160334
first 161057
acquaintance 161902
with 175048
Captain 177737
Fitch 86416
who 84352
had 119544
accompanied 140274
Rosecrans's 155194
column 44617
and 65634
his 170879
cool 15336
efficiency 152888
was 142074
so 84916
marked 182383
that 15247
I 51667
applied 51823
for 57043
him 87802
as 91255
quartermaster 124265
upon 152141
my 176599
staff 61107
He 87941
remained 92917
with 137433
me 150799
till 151843
I 157757
finally 51690
left 90994
West 10400
Virginia 22912
in 23091
and 26144
I 26415
never 29242
saw 30169
his 30257
superior 30300
in 30436
handling 30469
trains 32305
in 34956
the 35489
field 36383
He 37766
was 42227
a 44745
West 44975
Virginian 47436
volunteering 47626
from 48698
civil 49327
life 50943
whose 53402
outfit 57933
was 67196
a 69536
good 71822
business 99998
education 101159
and 101392
an 102467
indomitable 103538
rough 113740
energy 114081
that 114168
nothing 114477
could 127999

the 117391

out 142691

the 111723

not 118741
a 124728
favorable 127226
one 127256
for 129385
them 134260

long 160939
After 168501
a 179015

against 89642
Floyd 93222
who 94090

already 81863
much 92283
importance 92415
in 102079
the 123871
valley 142776
These 143487
gunwales 151498
were 164675
single 166315

a 2203

these 23141

very 56426
commodious 59951
Of 119948
course 120040
the 147739
enemy 154202
knew 168607
that 3186
we 175921
used 91595
them 151445
at 101059
night 136571

would 58651
fire 62044
an 140314
occasional 163661
random 65164
shot 3739
at 8381
them 31006
but 91076
did 121467
us 23327
no 126230
harm 5150
The 5976
enemy's 8075
guns 11061
on 12997
the 13060
mountain 18118
were 19134
so 19571
masked 20815
by 21106
the 21237
forest 24064

we 25252
did 25763
not 25962
waste 26235
ammunition 26257
in 27513
firing 31928
at 32134
them 34113
except 34879
as 37763
they 39691
opened 40108
when 41713
our 42160
guns 42467
so 44783
quickly 48001
returned 48505
their 48634
fire 48641
that 51576
they 51949
never 53600
ventured 53846
upon 54220
continuous 54661
action 55840
and 56806
after 57216
the 58276
first 61604

we 62162
had 62393
only 63085
occasional 63494

from 64677

We 66662

the 126339
only 126479
advantage 127315

on 153620
the 155545
mountain 157452

our 158842

invite 149475
enterprise 149516
on 56852
our 149541

His 149523
courage 81964

oozed 82700
out 31470
when 10749

into 169808

here 60614
as 60973
at 164645
Carnifex 24321

he 19012
seemed 66153
to 66175

waiting 92920

his 139542
adversary 156063

To 6278
prepare 23323
for 73930
my 24942
own 57649
part 57961
in 65099
the 65241
contemplated 69959
movement 87491
I 135818
had 141460
ordered 156310
Captain 164677
Lane 165144
to 106212
build 181439
a 58306

of 53188
a 63250
smaller 130193

and 10558
to 18000
rig 74366
these 77633
with 78028
sweeps 84825
or 97410
large 104929
oars 116951
so 117082
that 117556

could 10746
be 34106
used 43468
to 94330
throw 105016

selected 71152
a 2083

up 19540
the 18530
river 37502
where 114358
the 132552

was 64842
not 116588
so 31450
swift 4871
and 180324
broken 111001
as 9142
in 17113
most 70225
places 144447
Many 10264
of 91418
our 105065

had 9197
become 19063
expert 26397
in 26466
managing 29663
such 30325
boats 30423
and 37783
a 38230
careful 43759
computation 44964
showed 45413
that 45554
we 48004
could 55947
put 67032

men 71653
an 78092

subside 92438

heard 96451
from 96559
He 96628
also 97670
found 97685
the 98468
enemy 99463
indisposed 101540
to 103722
be 104140
stubborn 105474
and 105630
skirmished 106635

finding 39419
no 143976

I 145923
reported 146132
our 143393
success 143771
to 144011
Rosecrans 144070
and 12167
doubtful 12428
whether 18932
he 44333
wished 58942
to 58944
press 144283
the 144348
enemy 144438
in 144585
front 8098
till 130649
Benham 8065
and 10902
Schenck 12090
should 23900
be 23994
in 24349
his 38978
rear 42689
I 94325
asked 135797
for 151210
further 126467
instructions 13097
General 14809
Rosecrans 15073
authorized 30849
me 83602
to 89772
take 92198
over 94309
the 98743
rest 110949
of 141038
my 160239
available 160263
force 165683
and 169853
press 23823
the 30639
enemy 32125
next 36223
day 39601
as 39754
he 40550
was 40863
very 41444
confident 42880
that 47520
Benham 52705
would 53074
by 53511
that 56642
time 66143
be 72804
in 75080
position 82163
to 82468
attack 94753
him 104267
in 104387
rear 116888
Accordingly 121927
I 126632

and 95192
advance 130578
upon 141416
the 38486
Fayette 39132
road 58195
as 73772
far 4942
as 71057
possible 63683
My 3998
climb 5343
to 13287
the 19624
crest 19742
of 30797
Cotton 32033
Mountain 34144
was 43417
a 52258
repetition 52279
of 64699
the 73869
exhausting 73917
sort 78784
of 95389
work 106251
I 106707
had 111516
tried 116910
on 125947
Gauley 147485
Mount 167442
on 174460
the 3596
1st 5259
I 10544
took 15576
the 26079
short 29326
route 30244
straight 37785
up 45015
the 48467
face 50537
of 53308
the 71074
hill 72810
clambering 74198
over 74826
rocks 77442
pulling 83423
myself 84344
up 95409
by 95426
clinging 95743
to 103392
the 104981
laurel 105567
bushes 106754
and 108630
often 109478
literally 110200

myself 117273
from 124186
one 124190
great 124296
rocky 133148
step 134652
to 134659
another 147199
This 167735
work 173646
was 181277
harder 1541
upon 73834
officers 1949
who 104902
were 22531
usually 23991
mounted 69435
than 69443
upon 126011
the 87690
men 5829
in 70022
the 142319

the 21023
labor 22310
of 22622
the 35487
whole 40278
day 41498
was 43252
thus 43270
increased 46948
for 48056
of 52510
course 52725
we 53358
could 54710
take 55392
no 56960

fell 115461
back 115772

I 88809

was 93100
transferred 93300
to 93477

It 93941
is 94155
very 94479
improbable 95280
that 95398

few 99227

small 100028

the 101430

have 101824
been 101833
slow 101913

tedious 102200
Floyd 102718
would 103996
pretty 104063
surely 104195
learn 104417
of 104470
it 105245
soon 105788
after 106378
it 106489
began 106513

would 106686
hasten 107450
his 107525

instead 108201
of 108413
waiting 109023

It 109671
would 109943
have 110213
been 110259
better 110367
to 110484
join 110692

it 133093

all 167843
ignored 168007

greatly 168250
underestimated 169348

easy 170184

the 184223

I 75670

General 77860

This 78542
was 78589
exactly 79083
in 79259
accordance 79349
with 79436
my 79462
own 79589
strong 79694

therefore 83051
went 83311
joyfully 83428
to 83636
Rosecrans 83755
supposing 83766
of 84047
course 84548
that 84880

received 85137

To 86136
my 86236
intense 86613

I 86839
found 86866

he 86901
not 87198
only 87209
was 87284
without 87590
such 87698
orders 87714
but 87882
that 88249
he 88303
was 88356
naturally 88380
enough 88430
disposed 88720
to 88743
take 88843

the 88969
sending 88993
of 89034

me 89854
He 90017
protested 90036
against 90289
the 90311
irregularity 90320
and 91154
insisted 91288
that 91514
if 91560
his 91564
forces 91599
were 91840
to 91968
be 92002
reduced 92010

himself 92302
indicate 92597

go 93031
He 93138
carried 93327
his 93399
point 93519

the 169851
regiments 170252
repeated 170515
under 170732
more 170877
favorable 170927
circumstances 171080
the 171086
work 171095
of 171126
the 171419
original 171932
camp 172113
in 172337
Ohio 172379
The 172804
work 173086
of 173219
the 173228
military 173310
courts 173796
gave 173965
me 173970
one 174276
very 174341
unpleasant 174408
duty 174428
to 174554
perform 174656
which 174663
happily 174915
was 175463
of 175499
rare 175503
occurrence 175692
and 175702
never 175895
again 175934
fell 176102
to 176122
my 176168
lot 176260
except 176411
on 176414
a 176536
single 176776
occasion 176934
in 177302
North 177779
Carolina 178227
near 178329
the 178339
close 178353
of 178438
the 178470
war 178480
A 178946
soldier 179005
of 179097
the 179568
First 179810
Kentucky 179942
Volunteers 180285
was 180374
condemned 180391
to 180418
death 180433
for 180444
desertion 180461
mutiny 180585
and 180651
a 180683
murderous 180768
assault 180825
upon 181136
another 181279
soldier 181384
The 181449
circumstances 181819
were 181824
a 181998
little 182357
peculiar 182404
and 182521
gave 182563
rise 182583
to 182792
fears 182890
that 182941
his 182991
regiment 182998
might 183182
resist 183216
the 183581
execution 183990
I 183999
have 184261
already 184420
mentioned 184626
the 184771
affair 184926
of 184966
Captain 185102
Gibbs 157347
Footnote 122559
Appointed 184744
Captain 184909
and 184941
Assistant 84322

of 143143
Subsistence 143190
U 145174

who 26392
had 67067
shot 67091
down 96840
a 61632
mutinous 61697
man 61753
of 61825
the 61867
Second 61922
Kentucky 59983
at 61730
Gauley 19651
Bridge 84806
in 112045
the 112541
summer 2010
and 111373
who 23338
had 55241
been 183891
acquitted 12005
by 101893
a 153849
court-martial 183883
The 50427
camp 76302
is 133490
very 77185
like 67622
a 80253
city 94857
in 69282
which 3923
popular 3939
impressions 5397
and 5535
rumors 7242
have 13649
quick 16523
circulation 17319
and 21990
large 22631
influence 27575
The 31311
two 31744
Kentucky 33242
regiments 35417
were 36055
so 43235
closely 46812
related 54171
as 55864
to 93890
be 103562
almost 129008
one 139026
and 139495
were 141897
subject 143964
to 143998
the 144200
same 147191
influences 149119
A 150253
bitter 151163
feeling 160639
toward 167034
Captain 176052
Gibbs 4589
prevailed 5558
in 14613
them 15807
both 17205
and 20507
camp 20995
demagogues 24436
busied 25074
themselves 33151
in 33742
trying 34761
to 35808
make 36004
mischief 38307
by 38972
commenting 39278
on 39306
the 47440
fact 49392
that 50630
the 53435
officer 58615
was 59523
acquitted 60901
whilst 63367
the 63556
private 67888
was 69183
condemned 85355
There 88441
was 88451
not 88459
a 89257
particle 93174
of 94981
justice 95013
in 100479
this 106758
for 109427
the 114432
one 114609
had 118063
simply 121416
suppressed 131923
a 133446
mutiny 133576
whereas 134133
the 137902
other 139749
was 140815
inciting 140899
one 145876
But 145946
it 146267
is 146729
not 148409
necessary 148595
for 150218
complaints 153777
to 154782
be 158680
just 159918
among 162567
those 166657
who 167076
are 169046
very 172208
imperfectly 172992
informed 175814
in 178454
regard 179168
to 182035
the 182238
facts 15067
and 56400
very 68885
unpleasant 106650
reports 108223
were 120559
received 121713
as 130064
to 143378
the 146684
condition 164718
of 4539
things 64456
in 127353
the 133284
regiment 112872
to 3559
which 3686
the 4607
condemned 4788
man 7866
belonged 8406
It 8691
is 9096
the 9180
military 9482
custom 9785
in 9822
executions 10245
by 10564
shooting 12021
to 12132
select 12617
the 12875
firing 13265
party 13399
from 13937
the 14913
regiment 15141
to 15199
which 15523
the 16419
condemned 19561
man 21488
belongs 21567
To 24096
have 24575
changed 25093
the 25672
rule 26362
would 28818
have 32947
looked 34170
like 34211
timidity 34453
and 34628
I 37598
determined 40186
that 40360
it 40530
must 41424
not 41432
be 41474
done 44877
but 44921
resolved 45219
upon 46246
an 46355
order 47130
of 47398
procedure 49253
which 49341
would 50395
provide 55430
as 56858
far 59469
as 60357
possible 61693
against 72544
the 72987
chances 79544
of 79661
interference 81808
On 82048
such 82341
occasions 82527
the 83395
troops 84427
are 85133
usually 85961
paraded 90671
upon 91876
three 91922
sides 92064
of 92538
a 92582
hollow 92701
square 93958
without 94464
arms 96111
the 96754
place 97161
of 97188
execution 97635
being 97772
in 97967
the 98088
middle 98186
of 98288
the 98651
open 99205
side 99243
where 100567
the 103569
prisoner 104506
kneels 105083
upon 105972
his 106381
coffin 106694
The 107301
place 107383
chosen 107654
was 108002
in 109404
the 110096
meadows 111675
on 111836
the 112708
lower 113269
side 113980
of 114893
the 116036
Elk 116871
River 118126
opposite 120580
Charleston 120851
a 122302
short 122690
distance 122845
from 124193
the 128597
regimental 128646
camp 128864
The 129250
camps 129426
of 129897
two 131190
other 133036
regiments 135075
at 136217
the 137286
post 138843
were 144927
half 147427
a 152275
mile 157638
from 161641
the 162256
place 163515
of 163627
execution 168145
These 168426
regiments 168906
were 169753
therefore 169988
marched 171231
to 175461
the 176089
field 176376
with 180322
their 181740
arms 5086
That 6925
to 7002
which 7026
the 7199
prisoner 8306
belonged 9156
was 10067
marched 10289
without 10569
arms 10622
to 10767
its 10971
position 11389
as 11572
the 11624
centre 12000
of 12242
the 12355
parade 12366
and 12463
the 12619
others 12732
were 13176
formed 13217
on 13295
their 13355
right 14022
and 14254
left 14345
at 14924
right 14991
angles 15143
thus 15675
forming 16757
the 16992
three 17025
sides 19095
of 19802
the 19835
enclosure 19869
The 19891
arms 20133
of 20176
these 20469
last 20876
regiments 21951
were 24067
stacked 24281
immediately 24770
behind 25186
them 25234
where 25957
they 25996
could 26107
be 26126
seized 26325
in 27325
a 28152
moment 30862
but 31264
the 31378
parade 34205
was 34737
formed 35719
without 36042
muskets 36135
Captain 36874
Gibbs 36957
was 38071
on 39613
duty 39736
as 40173
commissary 40206
at 40382
my 40506
headquarters 40623
and 40839
his 40931
appearance 41022
with 41162
the 41437
staff 41595
would 43194
have 43427
been 44094
unpleasant 44433
to 44466
himself 45331
as 46551
well 46581
as 46867
a 47479
possible 47670
cause 47861
of 47923
excitement 48336
in 48631
the 51383
Kentucky 51399
regiment 51529
To 51578
solve 51788
the 52055
difficulty 54050
without 54713
making 54752
a 56939
significant 61803
exception 70014
I 71127
ordered 73479
only 73998
the 74083
personal 74205
staff 76990
and 77067
the 78499
adjutant-general 78623
with 79974
the 80333
chief 91093
surgeon 91136
to 91246
accompany 93034
me 93592
leaving 93924
out 94135
the 94404
administrative 94594
officers 96726
of 96780
both 102318
quartermaster's 120231
and 120634
commissary's 121210
departments 122508
When 122591
the 123130
parade 131960
was 134308
formed 136940
I 139529
took 140915
my 155521
place 156912
with 164189
my 165517
staff 167425
at 167479
the 168877
right 172465
of 174437
the 176571
line 176679
and 181358
as 2167
upon 118856
a 790
review 9848
rode 75155
slowly 41641
down 63890
the 537
whole 1696
line 5348
on 6507
the 6631
inside 11785
of 14299
the 17184
square 17260
In 21256
going 21585
along 23386
the 26723
front 28306
of 28830
the 29524
First 34535
Kentucky 36905
I 37850
took 37918
especial 38053
pains 39446
to 41222
meet 49772
the 50060
eyes 51314
of 52443
the 58324
men 59545
as 59762
they 61095
were 62605
turned 63056
to 63202
me 63376
in 65410
passing 65620
desirous 65805
of 66453
impressing 66575
them 67022
with 67594
my 67808
own 68639
feeling 69029
that 69080
it 69290
was 70655
a 70828
solemn 73718
but 74684
inevitable 74865
duty 76498
Immediately 77974
after 79617
we 80411
returned 81067
to 81555
our 81617
places 82398
the 83274
music 83876
of 84338
the 84981
dead-march 85113
was 85221
heard 85281
and 85296
an 85576
ambulance 85685
was 85909
seen 87600
approaching 88329
from 88464
the 88839
camp 89595
escorted 89732
by 93879
the 99723
provost-marshal 100163
and 101707
the 102124
execution 118637
party 122888
with 123009
the 123094
music 123202
The 124445
solemn 124769
strains 124854
the 126362
slow 127509
funereal 127636
step 127822
of 128028
the 128765
soldiers 129959
the 130089
closed 130311
ambulance 130556
the 130968
statue-like 131439
stillness 133410
of 133493
the 140186
paraded 142140
troops 142583
made 148039
an 148766
impression 151255
deeper 156335
and 158067
more 158314
awful 158657
than 159812
a 161252
battle 161342
scene 161771
because 162045
the 162239
excitement 162880
was 163165
hushed 163253
and 163655
repressed 164342
The 166167
ambulance 169102
stopped 170615
the 170851
man 170866
was 170895
helped 171523
out 171570
at 171806
the 172783
back 173463
and 174079
led 174271
by 175042
the 175124
provost-marshal 175251
to 176115
his 176281
place 177299
upon 177387
the 178010
coffin 178832
where 179844
he 180786
was 181489
blindfolded 181709
The 182119
firing 182455
party 1409
silently 65715
took 2175
its 118864
place 1578
The 2215
muskets 80949
were 118904
cocked 23673
and 41493
aimed 59209
while 69199
the 150410
noise 164125
of 350
the 4413
retiring 39143
ambulance 63596
covered 63733
the 85633
sound 93499
The 124570
provost-marshal 126045
with 150125
a 158380
merciful 26477
deception 93085
told 9946
the 6981
prisoner 10030
he 11697
must 15382
wait 16542
a 19371
moment 29812
and 44371
he 44786
would 48646
return 48987
to 51790
him 54448
before 54611
the 54638
final 55991
order 59278
but 70602
stepping 96702
quickly 102378
out 130472
of 148966
the 149833
range 149881
of 151534
the 162989
muskets 166791
he 175487
gave 176565
the 5257
signal 8851
with 13692
his 17889
handkerchief 21239
and 22126
the 22258
man 23117
fell 24747
dead 28134
at 31733
the 33432
volley 33444
which 41311
sounded 57633
like 57715
a 63188
single 65315
discharge 70798
The 84308
detail 88271
of 97283
soldiers 100814
for 104607
the 112377
firing 118430
had 118562
been 121611
carefully 122458
instructed 124588
that 124819
steadiness 124994
and 125012
accuracy 126545
made 126566
the 128308
most 129372
merciful 143058
way 147077
of 154979
doing 157343
their 162826
unwelcome 171688
duty 175571
The 182121
surgeon 182137
made 182487
his 182627
official 183011
inspection 183040
of 183207
the 183254
body 183474
which 184407
was 184875
placed 185022
in 185093
the 10408
coffin 10602
and 127258
removed 141451
in 18020
the 125169
ambulance 150628
The 163318
drums 4667
and 12634
fifes 113291
broke 62691
the 95532
spell 96958
with 106239
quick 109962
marching 115401
music 16912
the 18498
regiments 19292
took 19526
their 19574
arms 19637
sharp 19772
words 20392
of 20600
command 23324
rattled 23411
along 25435
the 26265
lines 32182
which 32341
broke 32943
by 37551
platoons 46705
into 46778
column 47008
and 47202
moved 47481
rapidly 62485
off 62593
the 64359
field 74765
I 80522
confess 84788
it 91637
was 91913
a 96918
relief 101564
to 101643
have 102788
the 105903
painful 106237
task 109620
ended 114096
and 155546
especially 164172
to 164278
have 165923
it 173814
ended 174498
in 24496
the 44827
most 19883
perfect 37705
order 44985
and 45031
discipline 64402
The 80667
moral 100939
effect 102569
was 104994
very 111632
great 115795
for 132269
our 132351
men 1145
were 44657
so 35507
intelligent 102229
that 4362
they 55047
fully 58347
appreciated 60726
the 62817
judicial 65286
character 84584
of 92672
the 96874
act 98796
and 122392
the 123537
imposing 124821
solemnity 125546
of 126512
the 129042
parade 135859
and 135907
execution 142707
made 142951
the 145808
impression 146192
all 147061
the 155894
more 159603
profound 159819
As 163313
it 164633
was 170802
accompanied 175313
and 181802
followed 184258
by 185068
a 185206
searching 185250
test 67247
of 10918
the 42322
capacity 44396
and 79805
character 17459
of 81957
their 46105
officers 53469
of 57394
which 149105
they 56124
daily 27353
saw 34820
the 38362
effects 52365
in 52940
the 57685
retirement 64890
of 66901
some 81470
from 130886
the 142945
service 46288
and 8732
in 21157
the 76334
increased 78435
industry 82207
and 82390
studious 86146
devotion 87835
to 133625
duty 148672
of 163608
all 3055
it 163450
gave 169409
a 41774
new 152012
tone 11596
to 19663
the 92020
whole 14872
command 22143
I 56969
spared 57658
no 58075
effort 59598
to 60019
make 61705
the 143055
feeling 146907
pervade 146940
every 149069
regiment 153197
and 65582
company 57471
that 58881
the 60040
cause 60099
of 39914
the 169368
country 45508
their 84953
own 140060
success 16994
and 20776
honor 41228
and 55672
even 66186
their 70412
own 78039
personal 81600
safety 84945
depended 92496
upon 94478
their 117096
entering 140801
the 141133
next 141539
campaign 162305
with 164512
such 165774
improved 166053
discipline 167228
and 171362
instruction 172408
as 174627
should 176013
make 177023
them 3044
always 163439
superior 3039
to 17032
an 25785
equal 28614
number 31490
of 31602
the 34223
enemy 54013
Leaves 55275
of 71459
absence 71796
and 73068
furloughs 74503
were 84974
limited 85036
as 85079
closely 89694
as 91979
possible 92374
and 98438
I 100055
set 115359
the 116775
example 131377
of 131388
remaining 132711
without 132750
interruption 133060
on 140984
duty 141006
though 141189
there 162331
were 162383
many 163434
reasons 164180
why 164269
a 165405
visit 166451
home 168163
was 168286
very 168313
desirable 169061
My 171949
wife 172014
made 173623
me 174118
a 181211
visit 1539
at 73832
Charleston 74763
in 139557
mid-winter 164166
and 178762
this 181337
naturally 130945
brought 92546
me 91897
into 162456
more 185301
frequent 650
social 5677
relations 9390
to 15040
the 33940
people 37013
and 45204
led 58558
me 72609
to 79377
observe 130430
more 133936
closely 142367
their 142451
attitude 143060
to 165279
the 7113
government 11722
and 11952
its 17089
cause 21461
Before 46057
the 83595
secession 103031
of 112841
Virginia 119660
a 124284
very 142745
large 142835
majority 164692
of 171586
the 1646
inhabitants 81017
of 135932
the 61294
Kanawha 5213
valley 5651
were 48485
Unionists 53207
but 55038
the 64110
attachment 89264
to 94528
the 119572
state 131383
organization 152221
had 154170
become 159828
so 32398
exaggerated 40566
in 52218
all 52994
slave-holding 77154
communities 115081
that 138726
most 145949
of 154768
the 156610
well-to-do 169166
people 127386
yielded 150708
to 92238
the 81444
plea 130440
that 150755
they 162425
must 5011
go 126419
with 39037
their 65065
State 118791
The 8087
same 61674
state 5680
pride 6658
led 10089
this 10452
class 11288
of 11689
people 12419
to 20129
oppose 22839
the 23503
division 23572
of 24018
Virginia 34252
and 42140
the 48366
forming 50821
of 56566
the 64191
new 67286
State 77468
on 78897
the 85116
west 95627
of 95715
the 96658
mountains 99440
The 99986
better 103122
class 103328
of 105285
society 107506
in 107641
Charleston 109045
therefore 110953
as 111978
in 121637
other 125629
towns 126654
was 138062
found 141972
to 145970
be 149256
disloyal 151358
and 152026
in 158053
sympathy 160607
with 172020
the 125457
rebellion 4363
The 20835
young 23552
men 28636
were 29627
very 50302
generally 60683
in 65934
the 67311
Confederate 70420
army 71859
the 74626
young 75308
women 81969
were 92041
full 99717
of 108751
the 115212
most 115556
romantic 123904
devotion 126574
to 137017
their 150156
absent 150175
brothers 178207
and 178300
friends 178364
and 180782
made 185078
it 6329
a 13428
point 37731
of 43799
honor 78664
to 87535
avow 104708
their 109523
sentiments 113621
The 121789
older 139255
people 152486
were 153241
less 154456
demonstrative 160509
and 77534
the 77889
men 174122
who 177702
had 178190
a 147905
stake 91405
in 62535
the 111028
country 181431
generally 6265
professed 106733
acquiescence 116046
in 116595
the 11598
position 2568
of 2808
West 28208
Virginia 31433
within 33405
the 34030
Union 40333
and 45548
a 52886
desire 54233
to 54968
bring 55001
back 56352
their 60120
sons 63332
from 70456
the 76578
Confederate 81321
service 83181
The 87358
necessity 92965
of 94276
strict 94776
watch 98849
upon 102523
the 118465
communications 128349
sent 131713
through 133191
the 139324
lines 139913
brought 140260
to 140484
my 143881
notice 144741
a 145561
great 147948
deal 149647
of 152299
family 152734
history 152842
full 153985
of 154139
suffering 154226
and 154441
anxiety 155126
and 155286
showed 155663
that 155757
that 155791
was 156234
indeed 157308
a 160741
fearful 163203
situation 175076
for 176886
a 181959
family 1264
when 50494
its 2562
young 140478
men 95035
were 154302
not 7663
only 13317
separated 39071
from 42666
them 42827
by 44547
military 54252
service 56285
in 75794
the 92839
field 98823
but 106977
could 130326
only 145600
be 146965
heard 149292
from 150684
by 154489
the 156532
infrequent 156594
chances 157496
of 53774
communication 34473
under 144825
flags 17631
of 70501
truce 154906
and 57046
with 70486
all 121769
the 120310
restrictions 61128
and 17016
reserves 25566
necessary 34571
to 35232
the 35535
method 37796
The 68929
rule 71468
I 73508
adopted 89717
in 98419
dealing 108467
personally 111591
with 114595
non-combatants 115703
of 117107
either 118746
sex 132363
was 166340
to 169088
avoid 172028
all 176412
controversy 2112
or 17063
discussion 111475
to 124177
state 14685
with 23113
perfect 23121
frankness 93636
but 166767
courteously 171256
my 3569
own 161145
attitude 161194
and 157840
sense 157864
of 177636
duty 143161
and 143129
to 39326
apply 55913
all 149626
such 3699
stringent 17617
rules 27620
as 27918
a 31904
state 38848
of 42770
war 51911
compels 52422
with 52534
an 53259
evenness 56632
of 57072
temper 57357
and 58317
tone 62812
of 70284
dispassionate 73760
government 83592
which 99474
should 110491
make 119122
as 119253
little 127237
chafing 127468
as 130833
possible 137317
Most 139919
intelligent 141153
people 141447
when 144908
they 145071
are 149414
not 151464
excited 152062
are 154276
disposed 157310
to 184719
recognize 184748
the 155192
obligations 3168
imposed 175903
upon 3392
a 7903
military 49858
officer 70160
in 87168
such 95576
circumstances 122716
and 128035
it 129446
was 130275
rarely 165930
the 168707
case 168983
that 172803
any 180390
unpleasant 28506
collisions 65120
occurred 85216
The 86545
following 118731
incident 119035
will 124673
illustrate 133117
some 175118
of 91720
the 87187
embarrassments 130961
likely 139546
to 21597
occur 47852
When 76105
I 101891
reached 155225
Charleston 156295
in 124008
July 124236
previous 137658
I 154322
was 68974
visited 72666
by 89867
the 82703
wife 2328
of 14586
a 14874
gentleman 16932
named 18711
Parks 18845
who 21998
told 22509
me 22542
that 26638
her 32386
husband 32692
had 35066
left 35251
the 35449
valley 43481
with 43696
General 46289
Wise 51161
but 57982
not 66286
in 66349
any 69243
military 69251
capacity 69487
being 69495
fearful 69504
that 71218
he 71295
might 72048
suffer 72515
arrest 72542
at 75241
our 75269
hands 76399
on 77672
account 78008
of 78056
his 78370
sympathy 79723
with 80305
the 80332
Confederates 82833
I 82934
told 83074
her 83086
what 83200
I 84977
had 85424
told 88382
to 90202
a 90239
formal 90548
deputation 91442
of 91461
citizens 91900
that 92029
I 92285
did 92417
not 92526
propose 92700
to 92727
meddle 92892
with 93052
non-combatants 93436
if 93949
they 94379
in 94403
good 95500
faith 95630
remained 95977
at 96334
home 96613
minding 99471
their 99627
own 99659
business 100185
and 101508
carefully 105400
abstaining 117645
from 118174
giving 118304
aid 123388
or 125252
information 125661
to 130616
the 131012
enemy 133023
I 135479
had 136049
on 136665
general 137555
principles 137872
a 137912
dislike 138181
for 138911
test 141040
oaths 141328
and 157670
preferred 159289
to 159350
make 160177
conduct 160347
the 160386
test 160886
and 160956
to 160971
base 161718
my 162145
treatment 162184
of 162279
people 163563
on 163896
that 164442
rather 164882
than 165606
on 168775
oaths 169127
which 169519
the 171368
most 173160
unscrupulous 173170
would 173236
be 173300
first 173717
to 174782
take 174852
Had 176145
her 176219
husband 177648
known 178418
this 178547
she 178700
said 178853
he 178928
would 179777
not 180524
have 180647
left 181075
home 181087
and 181105
begged 181143
that 181238
she 181287
might 1048
be 29123
allowed 930
to 21765
send 1729
an 88618
open 164470
letter 182899
through 69110
the 75424
lines 102135
to 112120
him 133433
to 165098
bring 4132
him 68874
back 172514
I 147560
allowed 68518
her 97570
to 122597
do 131642
so 140526
at 153167
the 166063
first 171792
proper 174819
opportunity 51833
and 80432
Mr 84203
Parks 95169
at 95407
once 95489
returned 95613
In 95796
the 97878
latter 98161
part 102641
of 102705
September 103008
however 103146
Governor 103435
Peirpoint 103727
of 109084
West 110534
Virginia 111126
thought 112418
it 112719
necessary 114781
to 116261
arrest 116948
some 117650
prominent 117700
citizens 118184
known 118284
as 151107
Secessionists 151430
and 173889
hold 179388
them 1885
as 104838
hostages 98900
for 119355
Union 21376
men 26869
that 65202
the 115159
Confederate 117754
troops 138198
had 141856
seized 154395
and 163262
sent 182105
to 184580
Richmond 184589
It 64420
happened 8192
that 13998
Mr 14621
Parks 42422
was 61928
arrested 63564
as 83852
one 86542
of 93661
these 96391
hostages 96630
without 98892
any 110723
knowledge 112942
on 114535
the 117901
part 128653
of 129686
the 135094
civil 162670
authorities 171324
of 176991
the 178052
circumstances 73150
under 170094
which 149742
he 64025
had 67864
returned 64410
home 48315
I 82892
was 94228
ignorant 123072
of 44467
his 24925
arrest 40751
till 11743
I 38851
received 52856
a 56582
letter 83547
from 84257
the 25635
lady 27920
complaining 50767
bitterly 10010
of 11393
what 24783
seemed 29368
to 37212
her 43363
a 51179
breach 80185
of 151012
faith 153455
I 50376
was 4929
at 155876
Sewell 3811
Mountain 17387
at 143364
the 146679
time 149153
but 3571
lost 105694
no 123353
time 153370
in 177327
writing 182430
her 40389
a 152282
careful 3997
explanation 5562
of 8434
the 144906
complete 84028
disconnection 57114
between 73544
his 73577
arrest 86477
by 105012
the 109368
civil 109491
authorities 117269
as 130726
a 140787
hostage 141031
and 155034
a 167976
promise 170265
of 170281
non-interference 51726
with 52777
him 65298
on 85243
my 153461
part 159705
as 162788
an 8069
officer 7366
of 15522
the 28934
United 41691
States 43891
army 57157
I 66667
also 67569
showed 67727
her 72480
that 76426
the 77968
arrest 80691
of 82061
non-combatant 83314
Union 88506
men 94084
by 102302
the 109099
Confederate 116940
forces 119150
was 119188
the 119862
real 120878
cause 127710
of 128673
her 130523
husband's 144150
unpleasant 147930
predicament 148142
In 155206
view 156219
of 156306
the 161578
circumstances 161588
however 161831
I 169371
thought 176579
it 183270
right 10891
to 67241
request 8985
the 10238
Governor 22982
to 28479
substitute 38491
some 46274
other 51693
hostage 68160
for 95839
Mr 99953
Parks 116806
so 155859
that 172644
there 633
might 1693
not 2126
be 22394
the 66658
least 81064
question 102440
whether 112934
the 116000
letter 116100
or 118815
the 144502
spirit 144788
of 145476
my 156478
military 730
safeguard 3305
had 11363
been 27394
broken 28386
and 95897
the 104970
result 24423
was 77490
that 30248
the 59299
gentleman 82169
was 46146
very 74154
soon 75932
at 75948
home 14881
again 30728
The 30791
most 38735
prominent 39296
citizen 58437
of 126468
the 405
valley 36611
was 58752
the 70632
Hon 140597
George 150295
Summers 181514
who 388
had 428
represented 7615
it 7934
in 8624
the 11803
Congress 14776
of 21441
the 22677
United 29217
States 29815
and 30647
had 30714
opposed 38540
secession 40160
in 42755
the 42923
Virginia 42988
Convention 44262
with 50126
a 52333
vigor 52367
that 53828
had 53841
brought 56862
him 58203
into 59837
personal 66771
peril 67675
When 69934
however 69951
secession 71201
was 73727
an 74163
accomplished 77824
fact 77971
his 78230
ideas 81497
of 83455
allegiance 83516
to 88236
his 88309
State 89027
so 89103
far 103051
influenced 111062
him 112869
that 120990
he 122503
was 128809
unwilling 130067
to 134453
take 135786
active 137146
part 141783
in 145313
public 147356
affairs 148019
and 150442
sought 152286
absolute 152887
retirement 153631
at 155754
his 156681
pleasant 160324
home 161464
a 161528
little 165582
below 170770
Charleston 174994
on 180867
the 39233
Kanawha 45565
His 98556
house 125062
was 126269
on 135702
a 150754
hill 152587
overlooking 153387
the 21621
beautiful 38928
valley 39604
broad 70159
enough 2687
at 147736
this 1105
point 37059
to 1605
give 80976
room 83717
for 126337
ample 6888
fields 7122
in 19600
the 19784
rich 22146
bottom 22361
lands 24276
I 29015
had 34526
called 47089
upon 55345
him 79126
as 90876
I 91349
passed 95413
with 96481
my 96664
troops 97829
when 106360
I 112002
went 114315
up 114754
the 115030
valley 133169
He 149061
was 153652
a 155565
dignified 156603
and 171945
able 182687
man 182700
just 183236
past 183818
middle 183845
life 184117
but 25838
in 28221
full 95297
physical 95929
and 106115
mental 106449
force 109455
and 109848
capable 111240
of 121588
exerting 139827
a 139895
very 142916
great 151957
influence 153220
if 153904
he 155823
could 12519
have 51326
thrown 87080
himself 87169
heartily 115399
into 155730
public 155938
activity 182297
But 183490
he 92004
was 92060
utterly 95189
saddened 97636
and 102778
depressed 109871
by 110429
the 115432
outbreak 156898
of 151381
civil 185138
war 185136
and 7803
deliberately 14820
chose 24044
the 50186
part 63799
of 3005
suffering 20707
in 40730
seclusion 163400
whatever 168508
it 169017
might 171735
bring 3046
unable 163441
to 178479
rouse 76201
himself 31331
to 67121
a 13474
combative 26908
part 33969
As 48870
a 96231
slave-holder 97417
he 117147
was 118348
bitter 124608
against 178422
the 183278
anti-slavery 185274
movement 25618
and 36261
as 37496
a 92467
Unionist 97803
he 107909
condemned 109635
the 117737
Secessionists 132103
He 132449
was 94530
very 159217
glad 123716
to 140884
have 185296
the 81984
Kanawha 146272
valley 175440
in 4416
the 4854
possession 81936
of 112034
the 31116
National 130127
troops 179468
now 150695
that 73005
Wise 96850
had 130738
made 169965
the 23764
effort 73966
to 82759
occupy 82761
it 124647
for 170048
the 10632
Confederacy 60823
though 14293
he 50084
had 56568
tried 150159
to 30003
procure 6803
the 7031
adoption 8548
of 8584
a 27904
policy 31822
which 39414
should 39511
leave 39663
it 39715
neutral 51938
ground 57579
--a 60297
policy 84966
as 85032
impossible 87315
here 88937
as 92849
in 101336
Kentucky 102082
The 118599
result 123879
was 127138
that 127899
he 128512
was 129555
distrusted 136226
by 142520
both 146543
sides 150273
for 161124
in 161274
civil 163727
war 164547
each 166476
acts 169499
upon 170366
the 156518
maxim 89143
that 5576
he 16354
that 22645
is 103817
not 124286
for 62581
us 74971
is 21365
against 36933
us 31142
I 55379
renewed 83500
my 135181
acquaintance 180252
with 10253
him 41737
in 24202
the 41798
winter 75056
making 41819
his 130678
house 135134
the 8222
limit 12588
of 15802
an 58826
occasional 67904
ride 145702
for 161686
exercise 83520
I 83555
appreciated 81377
his 139800
feelings 147894
and 157256
respected 184489
his 19155
desire 46542
to 94180
set 102376
an 60351
example 125433
of 125452
obedient 53501
private 86847
citizenship 115281
with 179554
renunciation 7359
of 10614
all 17779
other 18512
or 51767
more 54190
active 57467
influence 57816
There 98684
were 99687
other 126571
men 127084
of 161518
social 164896
prominence 30523
who 118497
had 165504
less 5253
hesitation 29927
in 30563
throwing 39257
themselves 58735
actively 105206
upon 105272
the 107612
National 108017
side 108108
Mr 108131
Patrick 108358
was 109160
an 109976
elderly 110601
man 110621
of 110751
considerable 110791
wealth 111254
whose 1959
home 104912
was 24432
a 67284
very 953
similar 21788
one 81391
to 125427
Mr 56573
Summers' 40657
a 19277
little 19464
nearer 76060
to 90161
Charleston 133075
upon 136681
the 164307
same 174260
road 26063
His 136625
wife 180446
was 2704
of 146683
old 147753
Virginia 152541
stock 159671
a 159836
relative 160555
of 168818
Chief 51543
Justice 34685
Marshall 9456
and 11745
a 12003
pronounced 15497
Southern 36328
woman 47058
though 51393
too 51465
good 52880
a 53159
wife 53269
to 55657
make 58174
her 63844
sympathies 74424
give 99002
annoyance 102166
to 112497
her 112855
husband 113360
or 114246
his 124004
guests 129700
Lewis 133123
Ruffner 137546
was 141570
also 154896
a 157261
prominent 162865
Union 171820
man 175219
and 178644
among 40219
the 106985

of 112205
the 91203

manager 7426
of 8523
the 23751

at 52971
Charleston 53113
whose 54604
family 75803
was 121116
an 121123
old 121277
and 140794
well-known 141441
one 149104
was 153283
an 154572
outspoken 157044
Unionist 166824
and 180212
in 1637
the 81008
next 53656
year 6961
when 12219
the 12381
war 13365
put 15093
an 15139
end 26417
for 51534
the 77806
time 79727
to 80011
banking 80197
in 80593
the 88776
valley 91708
he 91750
became 92522
a 148534

F 167559
Smith 169777
was 2691
a 147740
noteworthy 1333
character 3714
also 5990
He 7115
was 12573
a 13844
leading 23330
lawyer 47369
a 53155
man 53218
of 53497
vigorous 53604

of 57727
tough 58850
fibre 59119
both 59312
physically 59600
and 59639
mentally 70504
He 120993
shared 121164
the 121294
wish 121481
of 121491
Summers 121517
to 121580
keep 145275
West 145657
Virginia 145724
out 148931
of 154038
the 155022
conflict 155055
if 155113
possible 155149
but 155314
when 155962
we 156019
had 158512
driven 161050
Wise 27740
out 50277
of 120576
the 120281
valley 288
he 64466
took 120258
a 154625
pronounced 156002
position 159161
in 59940
favor 60116
of 7739
the 118600
new 132747
state 161663
movement 162653
A 165576
little 183134
afterward 54843
he 11709
was 14555
appointed 25778
District 45517
Attorney 54601
for 60728
the 94234
United 141824
States 141924
Although 153123
the 165498
loyal 169395
people 171994
had 54795
such 83974
competent 86924
leaders 104491
the 161275
majority 49167
of 39995
the 86868
men 130762
of 169956
wealth 1322
and 4982
of 8869
the 11828

recognized 29263
as 52591
socially 52615
eminent 56701
were 58345
avowed 59115
Secessionists 59558
They 62985
were 63550
a 91050
small 126224
minority 151723
of 58508
the 98739
whole 11506
people 56801
but 60764
in 61525
all 62043
slave-holding 63527
communities 149789
social 151799
rank 153572
is 57750
so 149101
powerful 141486
that 126144
their 144035
influence 15190
was 130677
out 135154
of 5210
proportion 34509
to 45881
their 54941
numbers 85914
Even 97082
the 98141
leaders 100418
of 109077
the 112609
Unionists 131443
found 151212
their 155353
own 157476
house 162870
divided 142220
against 12756
itself 17266
for 25258
scarce 30183

the 120980
Twenty-second 183952
Virginia 58423
Regiment 120224

Charleston 14384

the 35055

I 29191
have 36656
already 37452
referred 37736
to 44074
the 45125
journal 45802
of 132345
Major 176581
Smith 65650
which 1162
fell 44674
into 46407
my 46557
hands 49130
as 107864
captured 173395
rebel 46335
mail 19480
and 28692
its 46446
pages 96248
are 135060
full 144648
of 30012
pathetic 49174
evidence 173379
of 5090
the 6510
conflicting 6782
emotions 6956
which 7190
such 9055
a 9083
situation 10101
excited 10283
He 11798
was 12325
the 12690
son 12847
of 16391
B 22300
F 27155
Smith 34649
whom 36650
I 36890
have 37379
just 40376
mentioned 45396
and 49295
whilst 51439

My 98507
source 98722
of 101000
constant 108170
trouble 108233
is 112046
that 113982
my 114954
father 121877
will 124342
be 130569
in 142756
danger 142991
Wicked 146653

unscrupulous 150431
men 153909
with 154152
whom 156886
he 158552
has 160354
lived 160979
in 162066
friendship 162327
for 163549
years 164658
absolutely 164783

for 167724
his 167769

I 171280
truly 181146

their 133672

hatred 52526

here 115562
I 138204

lynch 58028
murder 67702
of 123379
my 125241
father 134870
In 137723
the 84546
next 107329
month 17947
he 23718
heard 73920
the 78600
startling 86830
news 29913
that 109296
his 36150
father 6564
had 16861
fully 43828
identified 44339

he 141919
knew 149955
it 157529
would 158624
be 158758
so 171094
Why 174198
my 74072
dear 133947
father 156062
has 104751
chosen 7125
to 24438
place 26437
me 48069
in 83463
this 138299
terrible 9520
situation 63484
is 180730
beyond 7559
my 130486
comprehension 52141
I 184254
have 4896
been 9274
shocked 43465
beyond 107027
description 51764
in 52126
contemplating 52248
the 161089
awful 154070

The 84521

distress 80602
and 118742
grief 20426
revealed 45434
by 136629
accident 154767
in 18662
this 71319
case 83094
is 137932
only 156671
an 157867
example 168534
of 171898
what 11930
was 138287
common 141171
in 158903
all 20496
the 183087
families 183100
of 184201
prominent 184828
Union 2880
men 157551
In 5256
some 60461
cases 60677
as 14042
in 60651
that 11553
of 15227
Major 44558
Smith 54669
the 56577
young 70428
men 149308
resigned 155625
their 167118
commissions 52890
and 157124
made 9331
their 11724
way 11763
home 12709
finding 14736
the 16024
mental 26013
and 32153
moral 34619
strain 48032
too 48817
great 57662
to 68378
bear 84972
but 92371
in 118970
many 142544
more 146247
pride 163928
and 181845
the 9437
influence 12498
of 12546
comrades 12637
kept 38677
them 15374
in 22682
the 57033
Confederate 57474
service 58938
with 60050
the 76610
enlisted 136173
men 7590
who 10172
could 55444
not 56346
resign 139796
and 23730
with 92376
hearts 108430
sorely 6562
torn 16851
by 16898
conflicting 18970
duties 19114
they 19268
fought 19304
it 20326
out 20909
to 21945
the 23172
end 23309
The 23498
slavery 25456
question 25973
was 26626
the 26762
vexed 27266
one 27969
which 28587
troubled 29019
the 31552
relations 32863
of 33580
the 36593
army 36820
and 37377
the 37556
people 37612
in 37934
all 39848
the 40445
border 40558
States 40869
My 41141
own 42520
position 42629
was 42869
that 42888
of 43045
the 43174
party 43355
which 43395
had 45846
elected 45955
Mr 47321
Lincoln 49336
We 49692
disclaimed 49741
any 49972
purpose 52283
of 65966
meddling 67838
with 68149
the 68241
institution 68339
in 68485
the 68538
States 68596
which 69748
remained 73464
loyal 74448
to 74561
the 75124
Union 82512
whilst 82616
we 82749
held 82778
it 83992
to 84829
be 89269
within 89364
the 90441
war 91622
powers 91942
of 92030
the 92074
government 92585
to 92613
abolish 92801
it 94565
in 94867
the 95232
rebellious 97187
States 97534
We 100390
also 102777
took 103370
satisfaction 107197
in 107512
enforcing 108992
the 111892
law 112564
which 113023
freed 114141
the 114262
contrabands 114332
who 114650
were 115044
employed 115236
by 128645
their 128667
masters 130531
in 131502
any 131911
service 132063
within 132108
the 132204
Confederate 132254
armies 132370
These 132436
principles 133045
were 133840
generally 135626
understood 136497
and 137533
acquiesced 137696
in 137804
by 138089
the 138390
West 139004
Virginians 150044
but 157740
it 157872
was 158132
impossible 158349
to 160499
come 160575
to 163039
any 167904
agreement 168720
in 172070
regard 172174
to 172231
fugitive 172356
slaves 173028
who 173112
took 173270
refuge 175436
in 3030
our 163425
camps 2379
The 131063
soldiers 11367
and 16865
many 16987
of 18116
the 23253
officers 34871
would 49427
encourage 65829
the 66166
negroes 66268
to 66357
assert 66378
their 66479
freedom 67583
and 69478
would 70573
resist 70855
attempts 78606
to 83609
recapture 106821
them 107171
The 129215
owners 135651
if 136290
Union 142110
men 147839
would 159366
insist 160698
that 168326
the 173126
fugitives 173285
should 173360
be 106919
apprehended 19591
and 37686
restored 38106
to 55485
them 68925
by 79318
military 80891
authority 85647
This 95279
was 98518
simply 103776
impossible 105446
for 110033
the 110648
public 115573
sentiment 115718
of 165974
the 2062
army 111425
as 1844
a 104797
whole 104253
was 106743
so 114950
completely 53518
with 42068
the 43651
slaves 83899
that 96223
any 100462
such 74670
order 149486
would 84005
have 101908
been 171580
evaded 110419
and 153146
made 155369
a 31030
farcical 35426
dead 48638
letter 74691
The 133124
commanders 142373
who 4629
made 5182
such 5800
orders 6821
uniformly 8361
suffered 8742
from 10720
doing 16462
it 19642
for 20666
the 23961
temper 24298
of 27664
the 29359
volunteer 36233
army 40194
was 45081
such 48611
that 54434
the 54667
orders 61412
were 67591
looked 68281
upon 68441
as 72099
evidence 73191
of 78289
sympathy 79117
with 80327
the 82958
rebellion 87246
and 94952
destroyed 95234
the 95814
usefulness 96214
of 97074
the 98534
general 104321
by 104433
creating 106099
an 106267
incurable 107828
distrust 109918
of 112197
him 114504
among 116015
his 116989
own 118066
men 118258
Yet 119153
nearly 119350
all 119508
the 119785
department 121969
commanders 126786
felt 134234
obliged 135215
at 139775
first 145328
by 149893
what 151195
they 154654
regarded 154868
as 157077
the 158763
letter 159538
of 162483
the 162577
law 163766
to 164661
order 166831
that 171004
fugitive 172580
slaves 177085
claimed 177309
by 178047
loyal 178328
citizens 178352
should 182192
be 184836
arrested 40054
if 41049
within 2086
the 13130
camps 29182
and 43959
delivered 111449
up 13429
Within 59345
the 99077
district 152257
of 152406
the 154851
Kanawha 155335
I 11311
tried 12779
to 31110
avoid 34426
the 34482
difficulty 793
by 9851
stringent 10516
orders 141530
that 1927
slaves 9982
should 9995
be 19661
kept 30314
out 32220
of 32718
the 37415
camps 37651
but 40998
I 66483
declined 72403
to 72597
order 75324
the 78711
troops 79451
to 80527
arrest 80564
and 83538
return 90839
them 97741
I 100717
had 104880
two 109380
little 114952
controversies 118100
on 127419
the 136445
subject 140577
and 169705
in 171509
both 176397
of 177006
them 177600
I 1588
had 1651
to 1908
come 2228
in 6181
collision 6710
with 6804
Colonel 6828
Benjamin 6867
Smith 8250
After 8549
they 9729
were 12239
over 12729
we 12873
became 15695
good 15740
friends 15900
but 16122
the 16793
facts 17417
are 17480
too 18172
important 18500
an 18897
illustration 18928
of 20684
the 21101
war-time 21148
and 21216
its 21602
troubles 21976
to 22052
be 22898
omitted 24255
The 24938
first 25016
raised 25066
the 25158
question 25375
of 25841
contraband 26471
A 26629
negro 26818
man 26978
was 27086
brought 27703
into 27847
my 28455
camp 28887
by 28982
my 33232
advance-guard 33651
as 34218
we 34547
were 34632
following 34804
Floyd 34824
to 34919
Sewell 35030
Mountain 36241
in 36343
September 36622
He 36781
was 37128
the 37283
body-servant 37293
of 38129
Major 38390
Smith 38854
and 39631
had 39835
deserted 40292
the 41191
major 41207
with 42115
the 42609
intention 42856
of 43591
getting 44224
back 44271
to 44404
his 45208
family 46162
at 47145
Charleston 47551
In 48622
our 49318
camp 49511
he 49737
soon 50399
learned 50665
that 51227
he 51251
was 51274
free 51366
under 52273
the 52406
Act 55079
of 55826
Congress 57238
and 57504
he 57550
remained 57677
with 57700
us 57879
the 57976
servants 58999
about 59349
headquarters 59789
giving 60317
him 60998
food 62655
When 63041
I 63797
returned 65208
to 65218
Gauley 65505
Bridge 65590
Mr 65628
Smith 66160
appeared 66601
and 66634
demanded 66764
the 66871
return 67407
of 68432
the 68950
man 69092
to 69153
him 69307
claiming 69358
him 69596
as 69634
his 69701
slave 69745
He 70203
however 70337
admitted 70737
that 71684
he 72141
had 72393
been 72431
servant 72573
to 72921
Major 73135
Smith 74332
in 74596
the 74699
rebel 75365
army 75383
with 75415
his 75442
consent 75559
The 76011
man 76375
refused 76506
to 76534
go 76614
with 76622
him 76762
and 76954
I 77105
refused 77275
to 78199
use 78255
compulsion 78944
informing 79197
Mr 79749
Smith 80208
that 80959
the 81022
Act 81430
of 81472
Congress 81668
made 81790
him 82092
free 82191
The 82309
claimant 82409
then 82680
went 82722
to 82736
General 82756
Rosecrans 82830
and 83319
I 83358
was 83628
surprised 84056
by 84233
the 84328
receipt 84779
shortly 85585

Again 129322
I 129806
gave 129879
a 130901
temperate 131143
and 131178
clear 131429
statement 132668
of 133145
the 133303
facts 133589
adding 133681
that 133781
I 133806
had 133968
reason 133990
to 134265
believe 134688
the 134752
man 134934
had 135394
now 135433
taken 135573
advantage 135584
of 135761

Ohio 136778
Mr 136919
Smith's 136991
case 137289
thus 137497
ended 138001
but 138702
it 138715
left 138978
him 139018
with 139058
a 140634
good 140807
deal 141638
of 142439
irritation 142558
at 142880
what 142892
he 146492
thought 146541
a 146602
wrong 147848
done 147932
to 147997
him 148064
as 148799
well 148892
as 148963
insubordination 149868
on 150235
my 150278
part 151624
In 151965
March 154051
following 156260
another 156365
case 156480
arose 156651
and 157631
I 158091
received 158633
a 158735
paper 159106
from 160619
headquarters 161553
containing 163080
an 163705
alleged 163735
statement 165372
of 165473
the 165790
facts 168095
and 168367
referred 168381
to 168441
me 168542
in 168560
usual 168682
course 168948
for 170465
report 171376
I 171911
had 172031
been 172227
absent 172873
from 173202
Charleston 173530
when 173689
the 175098
incidents 175353
occurred 177420
but 178522
made 179101
careful 179294
inquiry 180974
satisfying 181100
myself 181397
of 182452
the 1808
truth 99576
and 1501
perhaps 73793
cannot 1687
give 81058
an 2262
intelligent 126116
explanation 752
better 2404
than 3327
by 131088
quoting 1660
the 81031
report 877
itself 16237
for 5856
its 30114
tone 82326
shows 88054
the 88071
sort 94220
of 163101
annoyance 166894
I 127979
felt 155252
and 157451
it 14985
exhibits 16582
some 16917
of 18574
the 21304
conditions 39439
of 40969
an 43882
army 45105
command 51101
involving 65665
administrative 69579
duties 74006
that 75875
were 84201
far 87565
from 87573
pleasant 88842
I 92306
said 95852
The 99111

the 39544
jailer 57668
at 59042
the 62557
county 62663
jail 63951
Its 65085
composition 65283
is 70451
so 70624
peculiar 71593
that 78718
it 82356
is 82798
difficult 83641
to 83765
tell 84070
what 88092
part 89069
of 89539
the 91277
statement 91341
is 94571
Slack's 98577

and 102151
what 102176
is 102903
Colonel 107183
Smith's 108791
and 120352
therefore 124068
I 125874
do 128472
not 130119
know 139328
whom 141041

hold 146474
responsible 146512
for 147972
the 148015

contained 158580
in 161489
it 162408
Mr 162900
Slack 165601
is 166759
a 168359
respectable 170668
young 170751
man 170886
who 174753
I 177429
believe 124804
would 165871
do 34646
his 38300
duty 54526
as 54581
far 63988
as 67730
he 69928
understands 70584
it 83556
but 91007
who 93812
has 94031
not 98880
energy 100298
enough 102364
to 104580
keep 105750
him 110396
from 128177
being 140879

Mr 161833
Kelly 166256
the 169375
jailer 173467
is 1468
sufficiently 65774
described 1103
when 37057
I 157
state 7938
the 24206
fact 32238
that 32322
he 36836
has 43035
attempted 43369
to 46011
add 48985
to 49323
his 55297

has 129361
lost 129394
no 130093
opportunity 133107

annoying 159344
to 159665
the 159816

This 142278
reference 144975
to 166859
the 168214
parties 1420
concerned 65726
is 47991
necessary 157850
to 84289

The 128201

knowing 138250
that 139320
Hopkins 140530
was 140613
an 141336
active 141650
Secessionist 142256

had 169293
known 180659
Mr 1014
Hopkins 29089
for 52567
a 53939
good 8056
many 14093
years 57757
and 151537
was 152648
confident 157008
he 154108
was 90710
a 90438
good 5495
Union 6255
man 7319
although 7357
in 7384
fact 7667
the 7908

the 62000

of 69340
it 72184
it 72552
is 72836
very 73092
strange 107173
Mr 115015
Smith 131800
should 131878
have 132149
been 140840
ignorant 141503
At 141960
the 81833
request 100905
of 142353
the 39167

the 41704

admitted 10127
to 10145
bail 10162
in 10185
the 11045
sum 11435
of 11480
which 12658
is 13232
most 13700
inadequate 13753
security 13769
for 14074
the 14421
appearance 14494
of 15319
a 18715

of 22507
Hopkins's 22750

accused 48021
of 52419

himself 69390
returned 70607

sometime 169768
during 169854
the 45211

stole 106545

not 121955
been 123770
able 160663
to 160724

The 178991

I 127729
have 130266
been 149288
unable 51631
to 55305
trace 89600
it 128224
although 142673
every 6385

has 18235
been 22207
made 26860
in 31289
perfect 34051

was 100426
put 112627
under 117756
arrest 120862
to 129985
see 133691
if 134694
that 144421

make 145652
him 147231
admit 155656
anything 159378
with 178254
regard 549
to 14324
it 16729
but 18616
without 47177
effect 77006
I 95933
advised 97633
Slack 97851
to 107042
procure 124331
some 177682
one 14999
who 15037
knew 30887
the 34092
horse 35329
to 54507
pass 87696
through 108629
the 110192
government 135052
stables 168272
and 60991
teams 10916
and 77121
if 104361
he 6875
recognized 22384
the 66124
animal 183189
to 185186
let 185195
me 185398
know 9775
at 17277
once 61972
and 154866
I 161459
would 4210
give 15367
an 102539
order 122866
to 182009
him 50856
to 79449
obtain 120332
it 133735
The 144808
statement 175290
that 98656
'Slack 129020
says 182814
he 183209
told 183515
Cox 183569
he 183836

not 182707

in 137442
his 166139

got 55134
him 59436
and 45902
if 96813
proper 179842
measures 31901
were 54201
taken 63766
he 125598
could 6023
be 183703
had 85779

both 70847
impudent 86883
and 141738
false 54830
and 29620
I 48486
respectfully 158408
submit 160674
that 160708
it 184250
is 184253
not 184776

such 13867
a 24931
complaint 39538

The 85087

Of 15699

we 16205
simply 21561
look 31580
on 36902
and 41990
have 42184
had 42472
no 51656

with 134854
our 134929
necessary 137057

The 139249
simple 139968
fact 151412
is 151616
that 154389
a 158063
few 161760

By 87321
this 128447

practically 6034
control 11781
these 21203

Many 27598

in 59492
other 61465

The 161339
great 170793

are 102342
exercising 111488
their 129163

to 144562
secure 148903
to 154630
them 52291
the 84598
services 124705
of 150978
these 56518

Mr 150560

say 156291
that 172751
they 175201
made 179502
the 24752

at 49061

A 121488
simple 86849
inquiry 144451
by 60105
the 61550
Major 66337
would 90990
have 104556
saved 138607
me 145704
the 147815
necessity 154297
of 168914
writing 178192
this 152571
long 153910
letter 28963
It 28258
is 29030
due 136859
to 143477
General 185184
Rosecrans 40273
to 99623
say 138659
that 140237
although 142734
he 144872
had 185376
been 73310
anything 107484
but 143490
an 92461
anti-slavery 202
man 7736
before 11591
the 17610
war 31456
he 53863
made 56613
no 62977
pressure 109884
upon 141968
me 163221
to 54026
violate 54310
my 140137
own 148943
sense 9552
of 59908
right 64653
in 23474
these 94164
or 119205
similar 6310
cases 92204
and 65109
they 13624
ended 26128
with 34146
my 34326
reports 46316
of 78714
the 97419
facts 97834
and 116912
of 132569
my 133098
reasons 134492

the 168339
course 25724
I 73426
pursued 82095
The 167546

lights 28851
thrown 123048
upon 174649
the 174658
situation 149055
by 153264
the 155885
letter 143132
last 144669
quoted 146311
will 104776
be 67207
more 172188
instructive 179859
than 7216
any 12655
analysis 18436
I 30440
could 41129
now 44969
give 47068
and 54170
the 59133
spice 61759
of 74310
flavor 80275
which 84144
my 107993
evident 113402
annoyance 123574
gave 133138
it 153540
only 180525
helps 17903
to 67071
revive 81300
more 131942
perfectly 139221
the 437
local 2485
color 46651
of 66447
the 78030
time 83026
In 101353
the 112368

Mr 116866
Smith's 127726

had 148686
the 148778
satisfaction 148928
of 154314
finding 155402
in 157956
the 7010
intercepted 151512
correspondence 57883
of 123593
his 89497

the 140246

the 104703
express 139883
recognition 229
of 27008
the 39118
man's 86281
right 165720
to 181224
liberty 10790
by 145669
reason 146878

his 56857
use 16532
in 27484
the 43805
enemy's 54817
service 143554
and 10990
could 33265
not 57139
deny 67515
myself 88173
the 141557
pleasure 177880
of 35749
calling 45154
attention 54212
to 65131
it 70235
in 92499
my 155647
letters 156828
to 178066
headquarters 63899
My 66688
experience 127938
during 160134
the 62440
winter 62793
begot 143135
in 58925
me 119842
a 120023
rooted 120136
dislike 145185
for 119571
the 59830
military 61384
administration 114674
of 162889
the 7058
border 15997
districts 17166
and 17181
strengthened 21840
my 22420
wish 26798
to 28623
be 29437
in 33636
the 35386
most 35505
active 38850
work 43284
at 50047
the 53692
front 55327
where 57497
the 58470

were 73138
the 75133
strictly 76197
military 77160
ones 95673
of 99475
attack 104440
and 107387
defence 137853
in 139547
the 139695
presence 144247
of 146166
the 151495
armed 154240
enemy 157860
Footnote 163000
I 163850
did 164314
not 167121
lack 167540
evidence 168843
that 173792
a 176177
steady 178907

based 185156
on 79097
principles 91526
frankly 108252
avowed 112473
and 118732
easily 162729
understood 134577
was 25090
rapidly 128874
bringing 130156
the 134040
people 161689
to 9038
be 85223
content 42266
to 101106
be 111300

Union 145950
even 148632
those 2887
most 157558
inclined 10291
to 12248
secession 16899
This 18682
result 27276
I 29910
am 69224
gratified 69793
to 70984
find 76667
attested 76684

nation 58442
--the 87697
volunteers 154665
and 170788
the 129665

I 153284
need 165524
add 172507
nothing 175224
to 31426
what 45198
I 89740
have 123760
already 14971
said 172673
of 167223
the 185211
unexampled 6986
excellence 11169
of 15080
the 15347
rank 17584
and 38010
file 45266
in 56094
the 56107
regiments 89203

in 166773

when 30502
bounty 36838
jumping 76632
and 87223
substitution 121814
for 145679
conscripts 34665
came 145780
into 112901
play 170806
the 54655
character 103042
of 11774
the 31126
material 52811
especially 55270
that 55685
recruited 56061
in 94262
the 112502
great 119702
cities 142489
and 142654
seaports 181809
was 182250
much 160926
lower 12369
I 174452
think 182307
however 140624
that 4130
the 4175
volunteers 4257
were 4279
always 16380
better 17512
men 23286
man 16884
for 135650
man 64304
than 4250
the 21459
average 42944
of 61113
those 81531
recruited 81725
for 90772
the 119535
regular 120285
army 122101
The 122710
rigidity 4028
of 67014
discipline 120917
did 38719
not 183694
differ 169214
so 29001
much 31222
between 81541
good 132652
volunteer 146074
regiments 74507
and 151790
regulars 84403
as 141308
the 147788
mode 170820
of 19169
enforcing 28469
it 40286
There 68075
were 94678
plenty 117780
of 140010
volunteer 151677
regiments 161241
that 39151
could 166424
not 117457
be 9127
excelled 10751
in 43466
drill 818
in 9876
the 9159
performance 13238
of 26135
camp 104230
duty 117324
or 24750
in 36196
the 42852
finish 45185
and 47324
exactness 64927
of 100914
all 107257
the 126774
forms 142035
of 156294
parades 176091
and 36003
of 45238
routine 17006
But 39505
it 79215
was 123679
generally 130125
brought 73685
about 177959
by 172676
much 7527
milder 129884
methods 146813
of 183393
discipline 183476
A 12929
captain 22490
of 91336
volunteers 127358
was 167703
usually 182703
followed 182906
by 183725
his 183850
neighbors 184031
and 184050
relatives 184669
The 172630
patriotic 172670
zeal 172791
of 36
the 11450
men 21491
of 37881
the 81091
company 93338
as 101920
well 122113
as 146696
their 149271
self-respect 182628
made 182923
them 183364
easily 183416
amenable 183650
to 183772
military 183778
rule 183785
so 184075
far 184468
as 184509
it 182659
tended 183141
to 183294
fit 183827
them 182618
better 182641
to 182881
do 183084
the 183241
noble 183319
work 183470
they 183562
had 183583
volunteered 183604
for 184187
and 184235
on 185386
which 130587
their 39588
hearts 82142
were 89019
as 121934
fully 129863
set 130124
as 148546
the 149005
hearts 150951
of 174989
their 38947
colonels 66978
or 77714
generals 81337
In 82256
the 122822
regular 130459
army 46038
officers 90724
and 94790
men 100640
belonged 119995
to 120364
different 128419
castes 161990
and 9978
a 65946
practically 105168
impassable 105244
barrier 105253
was 105946
between 106159
them 115061
Most 116695
of 116844
the 6307
men 105141
who 105190
had 105997
enlisted 106113
in 106315
the 109245
long 110579
years 122570
of 61701
domestic 121143
peace 184911
were 1890
for 1926
one 1969
cause 60126
or 60701
another 61285
outcasts 61313
to 61708
whom 61868
life 61923
had 63388
been 63511
a 63571
failure 65668
and 77195
who 78305
followed 78401
the 78502
recruiting 79883
sergeant 80553
as 80832
a 82380
last 82536
desperate 82588
resource 82693
when 82710
every 82836
other 82964
door 83306
to 85357
a 86516
livelihood 86638
was 87051
shut 87055
Footnote 87429
Since 87575
inducements 88351
to 88366
enlist 88404
have 88423
been 88562
increased 88724
by 88808
offering 88860
the 89160
chance 89232
to 89906
win 89968
a 90166
commission 90303
I 91276
believe 91319
the 91375
quality 91757
of 91853
the 92741
rank 92771
and 92871
file 93028
of 93090
the 93380
regulars 93420
has 93713
been 96338
much 96501
improved 97191
and 98077
as 99115
a 99211
natural 99226
consequence 99271
the 99323
officers 99436
have 99798
found 100099
it 100191
easy 100305
to 100401
enforce 100504
discipline 100526
by 100557
less 102012
arbitrary 102042
methods 102094
The 102154
war 102605
made 102635
some 102668
change 103077
in 103101
this 103236
but 103247
the 103282
habits 103450
and 103478
methods 103506
of 103614
the 104045
officers 104392
had 104431
been 104503
formed 104566
before 104590
that 104635
time 104843
and 104879
under 104922
the 104944
old 107182
surroundings 107585
The 107823
rule 108403
was 109087
arbitrary 109557
despotic 109623
often 110326
tyrannical 110511
and 110928
it 112493
was 112666
notorious 112705
that 117352
the 117388
official 117410
bearing 117613
and 117673
the 118004
language 118124
used 118278
toward 122634
the 124467
regular 127310
soldiers 127317
was 127567
out 127589
of 127648
the 127679
question 128125
in 128180
a 128497
volunteer 128566
organization 128591
Exceptions 128632
could 128742
be 128768
found 128952
in 129133
both 129244
parts 129630
of 131181
the 134437
service 139586
but 141696
there 145997
could 146467
be 146494
no 146791
doubt 150197
as 150215
to 150341
the 150381
custom 157642
and 158574
the 158732
rule 158930
To 159109
know 159318
how 159666
to 159862
command 161106
volunteers 161739
was 166247
explicitly 168778
recognized 170154
by 171455
our 171507
leading 172153
generals 173438
as 176321
a 176355
quality 176538
not 176602
found 176936
in 177164
many 180356
regular 1911
officers 104864
and 153889
worth 153945
noting 156133
when 157178
found 157307
A 68053
volunteer 85625
regiment 101855
might 113554
have 136865
a 160548
free 181778
and 80604
easy 85125
look 97164
to 123725
the 143301
eye 167700
of 85289
a 50647
regular 112875
drill 182070
sergeant 66449
but 143783
in 2876
every 12869
essential 16392
for 18791
good 21398
conduct 22346
and 22424
ready 56368
manoeuvre 59286
on 78336
the 85906
field 87817
of 119677
battle 123065
or 123411
for 125899
heroic 128102
efforts 131477
in 142718
the 146826
crisis 151985
of 157547
a 159832
desperate 161702
engagement 162667
it 169542
could 170444
not 170486
be 170722
excelled 170807
if 170882
its 170948
officers 171178
had 171671
been 172304
reasonably 3084
competent 169590
and 27945
faithful 28349
There 28491
was 59269
inevitable 16008
loss 17215
of 110007
time 153214
in 112356
the 184230
organization 122689
and 27
instruction 42381
of 43647
a 56183
new 65444
army 67374
of 71446
volunteers 81695
but 107789
after 108503
the 136512
first 141313
year 148755
in 169019
the 172701
field 183407
in 183763
every 9319
quality 64178
which 67452
tends 124161
to 184315
give 184699
victory 7483
in 75337
battle 130433
to 10296
a 10393
popular 10429
cause 41596
the 10458
volunteer 13435
regiment 63883
was 332
in 621
my 3545
judgment 3650
unquestionably 4492
superior 4781
It 5435
is 5543
necessary 5704
to 6118
say 6144
this 6477
because 6982
there 6996
has 7378
been 7385
a 7453
fashion 7534
of 7850
speaking 8169
of 8293
regular 8587
regiments 8630
or 8800
brigades 9161
in 9413
the 9667
civil 10437
war 10496
as 11042
though 11135
they 11232
were 11316
capable 11447
of 12827
accomplishing 12995
more 13192
in 13575
proportion 13838
to 13846
their 14075
numbers 15847
or 16090
on 16553
some 19265
occasion 19293
of 19954
peculiar 20034
peril 20269
than 20581
the 20988
volunteers 21367
I 22765
did 23645
not 23793
find 24958
it 25245
so 25271
The 25406
material 25834
in 26598
the 26686
line 26752
then 26872
was 26881
as 27027
good 27105
as 27230
could 27388
be 27530
the 27687
weakness 27691
was 27966
in 28042
the 28055
officers 28671
and 29388
it 29425
was 29492
here 29498
that 29537
the 29587
sifting 29626
was 29725
necessary 29756
Most 29829
of 29889
these 30699
officers 31282
had 31585
themselves 32359
enlisted 32647
as 32683
privates 32746
and 34122
their 34686
patriotic 34700
zeal 35011
was 35149
not 35196
to 35773
be 35922
questioned 36413
They 36555
had 36992
been 37513
chosen 37663
to 37700
be 38030
lieutenants 38251
captains 39184
and 40154
even 40244
colonels 40367
by 40578
their 40862
men 40988
because 41039
of 41364
faith 41700
in 41996
their 42027
ability 42701
to 43041
lead 43336
or 43445
to 43991
recognize 44542
their 44850
influence 45018
in 45167
raising 45275
the 45317
troops 45805
Yet 46400
a 47385
considerable 47643
part 48433
of 48490
them 48529
proved 49229
incompetent 49888
to 50278
command 50318
The 50541
disqualifications 51027
were 51871
various 52769
Some 53478
lacked 54301
physical 55815
strength 55836
and 56324
stamina 56393
Some 56929
had 57212
or 57223
quickly 57306
developed 57429
intemperate 57850
habits 58167
Some 59232
lacked 60202
the 60621
education 60968
and 61296
intelligence 61914
needful 62542
for 62558
official 62699
responsibility 62709
Some 62715
were 62725
too 63554
indolent 64575
to 64731
apply 65983
themselves 66315
to 66344
the 66351
work 66380
of 66507
disciplining 66790
themselves 66958
or 67435
their 67494
men 67521
Fitness 67614
for 67659
command 67968
is 68043
a 68083
very 68615
general 69717
term 69733
yet 70605
it 70781
implies 70907
a 71688
set 71862
of 72162
qualities 72256
which 72303
intelligent 73046
people 73168
easily 73563
understand 73595
and 73637
attach 73895
to 74069
the 74562
phrase 75104
Self-command 75162
is 75266
proverbially 75273
one 75290
of 75522
the 75972
chief 76223
Courage 76306
and 77276
presence 77750
of 77891
mind 78451
are 78571
indispensable 79166
Ability 80740
to 80877
decide 81643
and 82162
firmness 83034
to 83692
stick 84500
to 84751
a 85804
decision 86445
are 86522
necessary 86541
Intelligence 86554
enough 86657
to 86662
understand 86672
the 86961
duties 87258
demanded 87586
of 88717
him 89278
and 89634
to 89785
instruct 89985
his 90655
subordinates 91141
in 91734
theirs 92396
is 93704
another 94149
requisite 94250
But 96194
beside 96438
all 97288
these 97584
there 98035
is 98137
a 98243
constitution 98301
of 100090
body 100132
and 101542
mind 101755
for 101799
which 102118
we 102145
can 102707
find 102768
no 102880
better 103337
name 103372
than 104432
military 104646
aptitude 105192
For 105283
lack 106138
of 106531
it 106842
many 107430
estimable 107615
intelligent 107686
and 107755
brave 108000
men 108248
failed 108708
as 108741
officers 108875
Again 108934
not 108972
every 109054
good 109681
captain 109760
made 110512
a 111594
good 111684
colonel 111846
and 111866
not 113798
every 114106
good 114124
brigade 114134
commander 114345
was 114831
fit 114841
for 114930
a 114977
division 115266
or 116003
a 116175
larger 117263
command 117318
There 117322
was 117733
a 118059
constantly 119492
widening 120956
test 121968
of 122998
capacity 123437
and 123643
a 124011
rapid 124752
thinning 125212
of 125228
the 125398
numbers 125808
found 125815
fit 126320
for 126914
great 127341
responsibilities 127451
until 128434
the 128601
command 128851
of 129435
great 129994
armies 130852
was 130957
reached 131701
when 131833
two 132818
or 132879
three 133165
names 133423
are 133676
all 134006
that 134029
we 134148
can 135101
enumerate 135975
as 136254
having 136312
been 136353
proven 136417
during 137256
the 137318
four 137980
years 138000
of 138060
our 138073
civil 138290
strife 138664
to 139262
be 139881
fully 140262
equal 140531
to 142012
the 142023
task 143194
Besides 143488
the 144914
indications 145201
of 145728
unfitness 146424
for 146804
the 147034
subordinate 147144
commands 147583
which 147794
I 148750
have 148780
mentioned 148991
another 149014
classification 149267
may 149347
be 149591
made 150980
In 151289
an 151861
agricultural 152164
community 153023
and 155115
the 155173
greater 155256
part 155563
of 155934
our 155996
population 156598
was 157651
and 158040
is 158279
agricultural 158943
a 159354
middle-aged 159695
farmer 159945
who 161032
had 161059
been 162451
thrifty 162820
in 163553
business 163792
and 164660
had 166013
been 166799
a 167091
country 167127
magistrate 167133
or 167981
a 168042
representative 168277
in 170423
the 171483
legislature 171918
would 172017
be 172108
the 172364
natural 173096
leader 173349
in 174110
his 174145
town 174441
or 174539
county 174766
and 174892
if 174912
his 175208
patriotism 175277
prompted 175375
him 175863
to 176511
set 176900
the 176992
example 177022
of 177039
enlisting 177154
he 177174
would 177308
probably 177315
be 177668
chosen 178046
to 178205
a 178225
company 178280
office 178294
and 178311
perhaps 178419
to 178680
a 179561
field 179827
office 180088
in 180371
the 180458
regiment 180500
Absolutely 180832
ignorant 180849
of 180980
tactics 182236
he 185338
would 24551
find 20997
that 158682
his 159790
habits 159824
of 27577
mind 159801
and 119852
body 122026
were 153698
too 153758
fixed 175780
and 155584
that 60739
he 84800
could 154532
not 40384
learn 64913
the 80743
new 84831
business 9542
into 38968
which 121241
he 17785
had 98830
plunged 119425
He 16626
would 141707
be 107188
abashed 178385
at 66707
the 32463
very 32587
thought 136570
of 141902
standing 148343
before 149481
a 156769
company 166664
and 166817
shouting 84786
the 85271
word 96586
of 183263
command 4711
The 8405
tactical 9188
lessons 16201
conned 16833
in 19404
his 20188
tent 20951
would 21285
vanish 21319
in 22032
a 22927
sort 23849
of 23875
stage-fright 24995
when 25976
he 26076
tried 29321
to 29713
practise 29746
them 29761
in 29920
public 30217
Some 30351
would 30402
overcome 30565
the 30635
difficulty 32516
by 36840
perseverance 37901
others 38322
would 38712
give 39790
it 40163
up 40297
in 40790
despair 42475
and 47568
resign 48138
still 50130
others 50341
would 50374
hold 50528
on 52425
from 52688
pride 57782
or 58488
shame 58707
until 60521
some 62705
pressure 63547
from 63813
above 64556
or 65952
below 67518
would 68048
force 70539
them 70615
to 71070
retire 74013
Some 74037
men 74096
of 74121
this 74827
stamp 74986
had 76458
personal 79921
fighting 80114
qualities 80165
which 81098
kept 84084
them 85598
in 87578
the 89745
service 91168
in 93235
spite 95054
of 102285
their 102457
tactical 106882
ignorance 113682
like 118144
brave 119667
old 131259
Wolford 133310
of 133732
Kentucky 134643
of 136411
whom 136623
it 137561
used 137584
to 137678
be 141376
jocosely 141394
said 141419
that 142977
the 143032
command 143312
by 148757
which 149610
he 149696
rallied 149796
his 151780

was 154320
Huddle 155045
on 157069
the 157462
Hill 158268
boys 158285
A 158494
man 160758
wholly 161068
without 161382
business 162894
training 165709
would 169028
always 171395
be 173972
in 174699
embarrassment 175381
though 175852
his 177240
other 178359
qualifications 178390
for 179997
military 180098
life 180381
were 180734
good 182342
Even 183283
a 183326
company 4802
has 4920
a 9401
good 30785
deal 58660
of 1212
administrative 50442
business 30097
to 24095

Accounts 55131

receipted 109951
and 126810

for 148666
Returns 167001

a 130871
good 137311
deal 156923
of 167110
clerical 175090
work 175374
and 178469
though 123903
most 94642
of 94929
it 174610
may 176810
fall 174284
on 3915
the 12963
first 14326
sergeant 15108
the 16082
captain 17031
and 22402
commissioned 23056
officers 25894
must 29176
know 43868
how 44482
it 46990
should 48157
be 48907
done 49227
and 50753
when 55023
it 56052
is 56301
well 58180
done 58373
or 59089
they 60246
are 60430
sure 60463
to 60599
get 60804
into 60957
trouble 61136
It 61230
was 61874
a 62342
very 64530
rare 68459
thing 78339
for 82352
a 85053
man 87311
of 90685
middle 92466
age 92670
to 94168
make 94248
a 103664
good 104069
company 113884
officer 119843
A 120701
good 121800
many 125514
who 127197
tried 128183
it 128524
at 129417
the 130172
beginning 132624
had 132673
to 137687
be 140328
eliminated 143453
from 143500
the 144881
service 149441
in 149631
one 153125
way 153703
or 154228
another 154688
In 156245
a 156467
less 157188
degree 157244
the 157470
same 164328
was 166281
found 166473
to 166504
hold 166554
true 166798
of 167080
the 168598
regimental 178049
field 179789
officers 182073
Some 183164
men 40596
retain 36472
flexibility 87435
of 130302
mind 146030
and 146061
body 146114
longer 147066
than 152073
others 152200
and 153635
could 153645
more 153711
easily 153833
adapt 153896
themselves 153965
to 154020
new 154088
circumstances 155397
and 155702
a 155726
new 155746
occupation 155899
Of 36444
course 49844
such 51527
would 127505
succeed 127824
best 1061
But 29136
it 31090
is 418
also 52820
true 154175
that 94075
in 146018
the 51407
larger 56008
and 143681
broader 152218
commands 155056
solidity 155114
of 155153
judgment 155963
and 156020
weight 156529
of 156628
character 157042
were 152429
more 153276
essential 12096
than 26301
in 29373
the 32771
company 35524
and 41036
the 66791
experience 75523
of 78415
older 80031
men 81199
was 87323
a 89947
more 90521
valuable 91448
quality 95075
Such 95112
reasons 97893
will 102733
account 102886
for 105454
the 105605
fact 105770
that 106181
youth 106284
seemed 106404
to 106494
be 106683
an 107782
almost 109324
essential 111248
requisite 111596
for 113766
a 114832
company 114924
officer 115118
whilst 115612
it 115733
was 116401
not 116699
so 117834
in 118335
the 124985
same 125195
degree 138132
in 144239
the 163032
higher 165948
positions 171123
It 171166
was 14533
astonishing 15260
to 18533
see 25004
the 25235
rapidity 26835
with 29787
which 34201
well-educated 43875
and 45342
earnest 47523
young 52151
men 60813
progressed 67353
as 69909
officers 73031
They 74203
were 74805
alert 76920
in 79065
both 81117
mind 82647
and 83794
body 93439
They 96928
quickly 100970
grasped 105999
the 107093
principles 108692
of 114052
their 114275
new 114863
profession 115050
and 115082
with 117223
very 130626

Add 22276
to 32188
this 33053

of 37082

cannot 14538
be 16072
omitted 84547
and 146561
which 149455
is 169838
yet 184845
very 185367
hard 54566
to 112757
define 183146

is 184197
that 59137

Of 85719
the 127048
learned 172405
professions 177267
the 185300
lawyers 1038
were 25041
of 29113

strongly 21735
represented 83714
among 149431
officers 141043
of 4443
the 24710
line 25548
The 30204
medical 32219
men 32253
were 35514
so 47239
greatly 78730
needed 78878
in 101256
their 111680
own 32819
professional 655
department 40375
that 19722
it 39866
was 40976
hard 41010
to 42548
find 43300
a 46973
sufficient 48625
number 48685
of 48783
suitable 48896
age 48922

proper 49133
skill 49239
to 71078
supply 71262
the 95215

the 100468

with 102245
a 103129
proper 111136

The 113658

were 115788
non-combatants 116287
by 128001
profession 1757
and 88646
a 163634

architects 55621
and 141434
manufacturers 149526
were 122502
well 149650
represented 156593
and 155070
were 82790
valuable 77350
men 108542
Scarce 14414
any 3870
single 4626
qualification 57300
was 78067
more 80753
useful 86359
in 87561
organizing 102121
the 112620
army 126511
than 13070
that 63743
of 177333
using 5676

handling 174266
considerable 175237
bodies 184816

The 120991
profession 13520

the 63690
law 85749
is 91849
in 116209
our 117687
country 122885
so 132804
closely 150572
allied 152271
to 163319
political 61547
activity 91000
that 96859
the 116089
lawyers 117603
who 127120
put 2586
on 140502
the 58550

were 163547
most 864
likely 4347
to 11757
be 16224
classed 16402
among 25542
political 47613
appointments 47648
The 47784
term 48117
was 48697
first 49111
applied 101270
to 102708
men 103338
like 103515
Banks 104346
Butler 112749
Baker 114639
Logan 115592
and 116085
Blair 124034
most 124928
of 124951
whom 124976
left 125393
seats 165509
in 165566
Congress 166435
to 167801
serve 172157
in 179704
the 180605
army 153772
If 31513
they 148941
had 116363
not 72446
done 72868
so 8320
it 10814
would 25408
have 29659
been 33348
easy 33611
for 33859
critics 33906
to 37325
say 37776
that 39024
the 45464
prominent 46311
politicians 48740
took 66829
care 83140
to 84190
keep 86956
their 92872
own 93580
bodies 94440
out 102861
of 103362
harm's 104294
way 106040
Most 109017
of 110056
them 110857
won 115479
hard-earned 117587
and 118646
well-deserved 122548
fame 132413
as 136040
able 138391
soldiers 164238
before 165809
the 169182
war 171212
was 2989
over 18352
In 29206
an 29416
armed 33676
struggle 50518
which 91511
grew 93164
out 93181
of 163384
a 164108
great 178815
political 16446
contest 17656
it 20557
was 29339
inevitable 33929
that 33974
eager 38146
political 40881
partisans 45375
should 48666
be 49533
among 68778
the 72081
most 72855
active 73880
in 74019
the 79149
new 87123
volunteer 89829
organizations 91508
They 91558
called 92902
meetings 99968
addressed 101192
the 101237
people 101413
to 102519
rouse 103657
their 108986
enthusiasm 109190
urged 115654
enlistments 115979
and 123494
often 125926
set 138229
the 151319
example 164497
by 165014
enrolling 165699
their 166465
own 167234
names 168685
first 169442
It 171866
must 171986
be 174044
kept 174793
constantly 177512
in 179347
mind 33221
that 33819
we 47208
had 112334
no 4580
militia 4867
organization 4466
that 12767
bore 15517
any 26671
appreciable 107689
proportion 45395
to 82950
the 98504
greatness 80214
of 98484
the 108111
country's 175536
need 141590
and 31933
that 163216
at 4822
any 63247
rate 108728
the 738
policy 3313
of 117817
relying 77515
upon 3691
volunteering 123938
at 149303
the 3609
beginning 28502
was 34456
adopted 83494
by 180384
the 29961
government 71060
It 73994
was 93318
a 28526
foregone 113533
conclusion 181259
that 7885
popular 44252
leaders 59233
of 123705
all 143124
grades 149760
must 152167
largely 59393
officer 7927
the 21246
new 79484
troops 81492
Such 89315
men 126027
might 148731
be 151408
national 161082
leaders 162671
or 170495
leaders 60408
of 4050
country 24456
neighborhoods 91025
but 110835
big 120489
or 146043
little 149208
they 152323
were 155849
the 163712
necessity 167705
of 175221
the 185281
time 79481
It 1355
was 56734
the 60842
application 35987
of 54173
the 27795
old 169983
Yankee 134968
story 159436
If 113913
the 106603
Lord 113957
will 116338
have 117216
a 71082
church 97750

I 181767
have 130011
in 5202
a 9374
former 16480
chapter 20040
given 21874
my 22127
opinion 22235
that 25292
the 26172
government 34219
made 40452
a 47286
mistake 47754
in 73367
following 108082
General 123422
Scott's 123578
advice 127332
to 130665
keep 138524
its 148684
regular 163554
army 167563
intact 174978
and 179284
forbid 181440
its 75276
officers 26389
from 46970
joining 71633
volunteer 96971
regiments 132191
but 162362
good 172334
or 63135
bad 163571
that 44955
advice 122150
was 170035
followed 10841
at 13909
the 21456
beginning 24180
and 25905
the 52374
only 80005
possible 84656
thing 134863
to 161233
do 172148
next 90718
was 184256
to 6262
let 184244
popular 184314
selection 184592
and 28237
natural 127498
leadership 10587
of 41653
any 12007
sort 14857
determine 15477
the 16969
company 23865
organizations 36251
The 45634
governors 47050
of 54072
States 62384
generally 62390
followed 79721
a 118254
similar 140080
rule 140799
in 144944
the 148939
choice 155099
of 155176
field 155197
officers 164663
and 176924
selected 179517
the 8165
general 13330
officers 84938
from 64029
those 31477
in 120419
the 132848
state 5120
militia 8465
or 140944
from 165864
former 102918
officers 123763
of 162325
the 164748
army 175675
retired 4579
to 9536
civil 16939
life 46596
In 70029
one 72956
sense 73324
therefore 80662
the 93702
whole 98491
organization 102578
of 127245
the 134985
volunteer 168084
force 175508
might 4765
be 20894
said 24862
to 37648
be 37743
political 43051
though 43334
we 43542
heard 72980
more 143027
of 143088
political 92326
generals 10734
than 14657
we 21579
did 33936
of 47677
political 91863
captains 106190
or 106219
lieutenants 108027
When 111225
the 114845
organization 132515
of 35115
the 45583
United 91951
States 106689
Volunteers 108122
took 119132
the 30252
place 19655
of 92423
the 130417
state 124020
contingents 124051
which 184231
formed 18955
the 113401
three 141244
months' 142789
service 144103
the 144126
appointments 145473
by 145500
the 145520
President 159453
were 159516
usually 162752
selections 170419
from 173004
those 177529
acting 177551
already 179649
under 183933
state 185019
appointment 5760
The 6858
National 41224
Government 85011
was 87819
more 98591
conservative 103035
than 112772
the 113153
Confederacy 121310
in 124941
this 136135
respect 161343
Our 162636
service 162714
was 164796
always 170985
full 175037
of 176825
colonels 17289
doing 143587
duty 145525
as 167690
brigadiers 181529
and 181552
brigadiers 181568
doing 181612
duty 869
as 16229
major-generals 87890
whilst 70066
the 70353
Southern 83438
army 20260
usually 104265
had 105000
a 111525
brigadier 153510
for 167293
every 24348
brigade 98399
and 10562
a 3362
major-general 3770
for 4043
every 6621
division 8687
with 9655
lieutenant-generals 9932
and 10553
generals 10600
for 10670
the 10885
highest 12048
commands 12769
If 12899
some 14676
rigid 17408
method 18278
had 19072
been 19212
adopted 19741
for 20080
mustering 20922
out 22789
all 23871
officers 24368
whom 24692
the 26489
government 28092
after 28600
a 28678
fair 33689
trial 34443
was 36915
unwilling 36947
to 40467
trust 41471
with 41533
the 43416
command 43609
appropriate 46783
to 46817
their 47502
grade 47926
there 49056
would 49118
have 49221
been 49451
little 60927
to 67743
complain 71590
of 71883
but 72272
an 73234
evil 73329
which 73980
grew 74575
very 75059
great 75245
was 75361
that 76870
men 77646
in 77691
high 78968
rank 79045
were 79433
kept 79569
upon 80665
the 81084
roster 81173
after 81883
it 82054
was 83128
proven 83191
that 84046
they 84885
were 85072
incompetent 87110
and 89810
when 90234
no 93344
army 93545
commander 93718
would 94058
willingly 96468
receive 96690
them 96751
as 99187
his 99251
subordinates 99423
Nominal 100075
commands 100357
at 101003
the 101551
rear 102622
or 104241
of 104469
a 104931
merely 105370
administrative 107494
kind 108482
were 108715
multiplied 110816
and 111532
still 111666
many 111840
passed 112325
no 112392
small 113050
part 117160
of 117558
the 117800
war 118196
waiting 118782
orders 122620
As 127646
the 128574
total 128622
number 128630
of 128669
general 128922
officers 128924
was 130366
limited 130368
by 130560
law 131798
it 131839
followed 134166
of 134525
course 136599
that 137352
promotion 137380
had 137751
to 137891
be 138434
withheld 139074
from 139680
many 143025
who 143086
had 143355
won 144613
it 145874
by 147500
service 149776
in 151079
the 151152
field 151621
This 152305
evil 155275
however 161862
was 162243
not 162462
peculiar 165514
to 167687
the 167853
class 167963
of 168120
appointments 168639
from 169155
civil 169212
life 169333
The 169725
faults 169836
in 170207
the 171147
first 171222
appointments 171272
were 172163
such 173188
as 173374
were 177697
almost 177725
necessarily 178128
connected 178153
with 178742
the 180549
sudden 11897
creation 23658
of 67863
a 73344
vast 76827
army 76848
The 96405
failure 179897
to 16893
provide 19331
for 20298
a 37344
thorough 49098
test 72923
and 74744
sifting 88871
of 99622
the 104285
material 108776
was 108889
a 110506
governmental 118055
error 168123
It 168249
was 20704
palliated 43093
by 46916
the 168109
necessity 4214
of 4528
conciliating 5065
influential 5773
men 6885
and 7233
of 7383
avoiding 9496
antagonisms 11492
when 12440
the 12739
fate 14848
of 15814
the 17725
nation 19104
trembled 21686
in 22775
the 23428
balance 24636
but 24657
this 25132
was 25913
a 25960
political 31340
motive 31846
and 31964
the 32688
evil 32968
was 35378
probably 38387
endured 40900
in 41457
spite 42373
of 43663
its 44120
well-known 50334
tendency 60153
to 69134
weaken 73383
the 75263

A 76251
few 76311
months' 76925
campaigning 78558
in 80407
the 86047
field 86066
got 86939
us 87349
rid 87810
of 88103
most 88801
of 90019
the 93568
town-meeting 117385
style 119810

military 122519
affairs 123744
in 125221
the 125915
army 126750
itself 126812
though 127347
nothing 129731
could 130182
cure 132677
the 133503
practice 136638
on 136826
the 136899
part 136935
of 137793
unscrupulous 142753
men 143597
of 147869
seeking 154014
reputation 154102
with 159306
the 159383
general 161176
public 161305
by 162677
dishonest 164374
means 164478
The 165485
newspapers 165814
were 167203
used 167529
to 168511
give 170701
fictitious 171977
credit 173556
to 174287
some 177524
and 177673
to 179132
injure 179903
others 180005
If 181796
the 183930
regular 184002
correspondents 184090
of 184402
the 85441
press 126619
had 180378
been 1373
excluded 56752
from 62993
the 63888
camps 64032
there 64383
would 64389
no 64395
doubt 64403
have 64421
been 89881
surreptitious 91374
correspondence 124466
which 58746
would 17125
have 19844
found 35335
its 35994
way 36107
into 42386
print 52199
through 54523
private 89722
and 91222
roundabout 92099
channels 96292
But 98351
this 100365
again 100452
was 110908
not 147596
a 165262
vice 172999
peculiar 130965
to 52044
officers 143207
appointed 106505
from 107888
civil 2526
life 5946
It 13122
should 14380
be 22717
always 40340
remembered 52731
that 54978
honorable 58016
conduct 58059
and 63791
devoted 64277
patriotism 84683
was 85258
the 88230
rule 90980
and 107676
self-seeking 119393
vanity 120479
and 122345
ambition 124115
the 130208
exception 130888
yet 140442
a 140702
few 140728
exceptions 144202
would 151111
be 152091
enough 163140
to 164615
disturb 164625
the 152023
comfort 52800
of 98574
a 128243
large 143043
command 168026
To 170827
sum 175153
up 181769
the 122840
only 154247
fair 54187
way 108506
to 126762
estimate 180259
the 91285
volunteer 89840
army 566
is 11960
by 38596
its 51453
work 65067
and 83484
its 104569
fitness 113337
for 140027
work 148553
after 151793
the 155801
formative 181713
period 182458
was 29573
passed 15954
and 39202
when 123394
the 123397
inevitable 104610
mistakes 121247
and 160439
the 113357
necessary 175158
faults 149449
of 40649
its 84594
first 52159
organization 24196
had 13167
been 14930
measurably 27590
cured 57589
My 83625
settled 125833
judgment 140119
is 147286
that 150651
it 156112
took 158678
the 161474
field 6837
in 11205
the 27031
spring 28114
of 34795
as 133789
well 148042
fitted 160231
for 161214
its 170911
work 178244
as 40056
any 45134
army 161866
in 138641
the 3702
world 11262
its 57596
superior 69627
excellences 81565
in 86960
the 94195
most 101826
essential 121049
points 125053
fully 126933
balancing 127081
the 127184
defects 130685
which 140312
were 143041
incident 148504
to 161205
its 165767
composition 150580
This 38184
opinion 49991
is 80774
not 80785
the 93875
offspring 118590
of 125181
partiality 125635
toward 129591
the 161680
volunteer 162161
army 162542

active 59564

in 119879
the 121577

who 122157
came 125981
from 140087

showed 160984
best 161003
of 184960
all 174690

salutary 145810

I 115206
am 122947
unable 129396
to 139340
say 148323
when 148473
its 148927
use 150041
was 153442
dropped 160072
It 166772
is 177460
not 16867
my 19216
wish 19729
to 20571
criticise 21972
the 26212
course 26943
of 33453
study 33497
on 35858
the 38057
other 39997
hand 42037
I 42564
doubt 43233
if 45727
it 48695
could 48917
be 48975
much 50829
improved 68799
for 71753
boys 72715
who 74461
had 75455
only 76035
the 76365
preparation 78489
required 81794
by 82465
the 82572
law 87031
But 88757
since 88957
we 95149
are 95794
trying 97093
to 97431
estimate 98127
its 100869
completeness 104657
as 105705
professional 108272
education 111704
fitting 113216
men 115219
to 116873
command 118979
armies 128819
in 128858
the 131980
field 133392
it 134187
is 134773
absolutely 138474
necessary 138723
to 139477
note 141130
the 147873
fact 148518
that 148980
it 149403
did 153379
not 153946
pretend 153966
to 154575
include 156852
the 158591
military 159147
art 161778
in 166038
that 168867
sense 171472
Its 173033
scientific 174884
side 176863
was 177747
in 179635
the 179957
line 180017
of 16620
engineering 27110
and 31940
that 40843
only 54863
Its 54920
prize-men 72788
became 131193
engineers 143555
and 154112
success 154620
at 172143
the 176828

was 11364
gauged 24792
by 32528
the 33362
student's 35645
approach 35761
to 40966
that 43763
coveted 44004
result 44833
That 46898
the 66561
French 66728
which 68819
was 72106
learned 72199
was 72892
not 74989
enough 80117
to 82223
open 82978
easily 83002
to 87862
the 88036
young 92841
lieutenant 95558
the 95906
military 98489
literature 106020
which 106396
was 109101
then 109915
found 110155
most 110423
abundantly 110474
in 112031
that 112433
language 112569
would 114745
seem 116341
to 116432
be 122981
indicated 127583
by 129579
the 137238
following 139405
incident 149927
In 164421
my 167376
first 168320
campaign 174154
I 176731
was 181304
talking 8525
with 22968
a 29734
regular 30405
officer 39344
doing 45870
staff 67025
duty 79871
though 80211
belonging 98637
in 101170
the 131222
line 134120
and 135672
the 154784
conversation 154808
turned 160490
on 163709
his 6576
West 41128
Point 44999
studies 45098
The 67088
little 67352
work 67930
of 72454
Jomini's 80194
mentioned 82338
above 83202
being 98652
casually 104747
referred 107972
to 118405
as 133233
having 137541
been 148373
in 148897
his 150165
course 160163
I 160257
asked 166832
him 169198
if 179227
he 180610
had 184707
continued 124948
his 129109
reading 129336
into 132568

Frederick 15735
the 109486
Great 123900
to 145054
which 178498
it 149715
was 2543
the 140459
introduction 13261
He 50424
said 19749
no 98026
and 54902
added 12560
frankly 151314
that 159067
he 161503
had 161819
not 814
read 9872
even 3092
the 12678
Introduction 21588
in 50864
the 76513
French 142831
which 161331
he 169598
had 1221
found 50451
unpleasantly 12584
hard 120071
reading 21350
but 27074
in 63009
the 70814
English 80930
translation 95766
published 110700
under 113081
the 133128
title 160260
of 124092
the 143126
Art 83871
of 178122
War 16180
This 130483
officer 11941
was 52208
a 91910
thoroughly 13820
estimable 55715
modest 155991
and 69995
intelligent 1139
man 8892
and 13784
seemed 14757
in 22734
no 25830
way 27853
inferior 27907
to 28170
other 30446
line 37093
officers 39921
of 42846
his 44240
age 44301
and 44356
grade 44585
It 44646
would 50602
of 50969
course 51335
be 52314
true 52447
that 56904
some 56967
men 57148
would 61754
build 63252
industriously 70192
upon 121654
the 137305
foundation 139158
laid 139267
at 141294
the 141410
academy 146007
and 146760
perfect 181700
themselves 181837
in 182163
those 51346
things 59578
of 62159
which 114017
they 57543
had 184308
only 54355
acquired 124883
the 125552
elements 184595
but 184622
the 130943
surroundings 184578
of 25742
frontier 79551
life 171333
at 175151
a 53212
post 137079
were 13702
so 96709
unfavorable 150093
that 184041
I 20413
believe 25573
few 37717
in 118480
fact 127015
did 147579
so 162493
The 25612
officers 10857
of 13906
the 148088
engineer 15678
corps 113136
and 152391
the 81479
ordnance 127943
were 184394
specifically 42723
devoted 43382
to 47033
scientific 48597
careers 99264
and 104938
could 117569
go 117580
steadily 184084
forward 89711
to 170745
expertness 177458
in 154997
their 126286
specialties 150543
Those 150654
who 42465
were 81227
permanently 81553
attached 89556
to 119033
the 124857
staff 128095
corps 151252
or 158234
to 165716
bureaus 6500
at 11905
Washington 39044
had 49453
also 2155
opportunity 19317
to 39182
enlarge 41735
their 42451
professional 45245
knowledge 52813
by 65796
study 81263
if 100993
they 112143
were 112202
so 113171
inclined 118844
But 119135
all 119368
these 125258
were 125659
exceptionally 130387
situated 147389
and 159235
do 170471
not 2179
help 118868
us 151369
answer 161226
the 3162
question 175897
What 13282
kind 173090
and 23653
amount 177137
of 179029
military 13733
education 149463
was 182356
implied 177256
in 25847
the 175771
fact 162742
that 48322
a 145018
man 59250
had 124086
graduated 127038
at 118410
West 184245
Point 1619
and 53010
been 56419
sent 80990
to 83821
serve 119712
in 81463
the 48617
line 21740
I 25484
have 178759
purposely 4951
omitted 52629
for 75759
the 120492
present 139739
to 151554
consider 151686
the 152401
physical 153666
training 157037
and 157433
the 159153
practical 157214
instruction 3804
in 40090
tactics 46374
by 65123
means 175063
of 146364
drill 15364
because 27637
the 80091
question 155703
is 146115
in 25521
terms 41094
one 79815
of 90306
science 95501
not 95629
of 100636
practice 134952
that 165946
will 166213
come 168538
later 70238
The 165614
conclusion 165760
is 13871
that 40075
the 130959
intellectual 78787
education 91925
at 17000
the 80034
Military 74936
Academy 89890
was 107422
essentially 108609
the 109586
same 161797
as 181787
far 52849
as 20419
it 20472
went 22192
as 25305
that 28994
of 31915
any 34391
polytechnic 34933
school 36972
the 80861
peculiarly 85340
military 93681
part 93751
of 94611
it 125783
being 126386
in 129101
the 134530
line 138934
of 159225
engineering 159618
In 169859
actual 170137

of 173862
regular 174015

or 176916
the 177108
conduct 177534
of 177729

For 21273

with 25311
an 27146

therefore 76343
the 87894

furnishing 90075
of 127361
the 127369
West 127442
Point 127800
man 127859
was 151148
not 159447
superior 167706
to 170306
that 170503
of 170585
any 172572
other 172705
liberally 172793
educated 174295
man 174622
In 177759
some 2257
of 126111
our 155527
volunteer 156846
regiments 25028
we 92353
had 108454
whole 110193
companies 112669
of 74534
private 119965
soldiers 142909
who 14001
would 91699
not 118987
have 122615
shunned 183651
a 183390
competitive 183144
examination 183295

Footnote 90515
It 90845
must 96227
not 114108
be 139929
forgotten 151224
that 156588
my 180880
criticisms 8335
are 76420
strictly 13154
confined 77132
to 79254
the 90643
condition 107442
of 129690
military 170774
education 181009
in 76429
our 102597
Civil 118360
War 138172
period 162169
Since 138903
that 103315
time 92673
some 118624
excellent 144141
work 168407
has 112133
been 123553
done 57506
in 33996
post-graduate 120421
schools 27454
for 27913
the 82854
different 142929

of 170506
the 170634

have 44711
been 141567
practised 161821
on 11631
a 11637
scale 14855
never 21690
known 23090
in 23798
our 24505

prior 30086
to 30360
A 35137
good 41428

has 43400
also 47293
been 49282
made 50548
both 51784
here 70921
and 74567
in 75007
England 76174
toward 76880
giving 76914
the 77171
young 80823

a 93212
military 101418
library 108115
of 110267
English 114243
books 144913
Let 163994
us 165052
look 166594
now 169436
at 172424
the 174097
physical 174151
and 178236
practical 173953
training 178651
of 179183
the 179620
cadet 24495
The 30900
whole 37371
period 60797
of 74599
his 74694
student 74991
life 79820
at 80521
West 80675
Point 80729
had 97308
more 103694
or 103883
less 114221
of 136501
this 137212
He 151472
was 164771
taken 167372
as 173962
a 174026
raw 180891
recruit 166584
would 171446
be 65543
taught 70448
the 89165
school 147223
of 160312
the 3963
soldier 22676
in 6593
marching 111869
in 112460
the 125132
manual 151539
of 151937
arms 182154
and 79999
in 254
personal 38750
carriage 41215
He 42902
passed 63867
on 64253
to 88707
the 94211
drill 108794
of 115302
the 141327
squad 153597
the 162601
platoon 176495
the 179483
company 182439
The 62176
tactics 141842
of 158864
the 178782
battalion 54225
came 76882
last 78914
and 182630
the 183653
cadet 183697
might 183724
become 184121
a 6358
corporal 32766
sergeant 43926
lieutenant 70600
or 115775
captain 177053
in 183395
the 183478
corps 185096
if 185350
he 182661
showed 182795
aptitude 183142
for 183297
drill 183829
and 183857
tactics 184299
It 147007
is 172806
noticeable 182788
however 183567
that 184107
Grant 184689
and 184723
Sheridan 184764
remained 2523
privates 140439
during 15716
their 22901
whole 23144
cadetship 30604
and 35359
Sherman 35957
though 51224
once 51255
he 54617

this 136561

connected 148328
with 148350
generalship 148462
though 148496
it 148895

The 171844

of 97978

not 2364
of 3221

became 51277

This 68195
practical 68409

was 68677
of 68825
course 69072
the 70450
same 70668
as 70725
that 74886
which 75478

in 91266
different 91340
States 91359
were 92738
sufficient 92828
proof 92884
that 92931
this 93003
training 93383
could 93397
be 93430
made 94768

It 97683
certainly 97845
was 97962

only 102088
prevailed 102314
during 102363
the 102446
war 102472
itself 102542
but 103764
with 103894
Upton's 103903
Manual 104128
as 104143
a 104211
basis 104288

been 104353
authoritatively 104374

as 104827
an 104835

the 105341
older 105422

It 106322
must 106457
not 107130
be 107273
forgotten 107300
that 107651
although 107837

fallen 108527

must 127850
spend 129521
some 133454

in 150680
learning 150713
There 162648
is 162929
something 167731

the 149545

both 185304

there 27784

some 28870

conservatism 58085

to 58542

for 74647

was 177479
generally 182234
against 185232

Not 8499

frequently 57097
regular 179202

the 126112
best 157594
weapon 178468
our 106235
troops 84845
could 123690
desire 98063
We 101151
went 65177
through 79448

with 7164
a 8854
muzzle-loading 14572
musket 22454

light 153445
smooth-bore 154236
twelve-pounder 156540

was 159256
our 161187
best 162829
field-piece 165272
and 165642
at 170346
a 172642
time 6601
when 161886
a 175204
great 22965
campaign 24464
had 26187
reduced 44363
our 49014
forces 64316
so 142872
that 97225
a 151636
reduction 5224
of 38402
artillery 3928
was 4197
advisable 4762
I 5275
received 5345
an 6445
order 13960
to 17943
send 19665
to 19758
the 23210
rear 23943
my 24011
three-inch 24106
rifled 28148
ordnance 32034
guns 32221
and 34300
retain 37450
my 37734
Napoleons 42567
The 44828
order 45754
was 46240
issued 46342
by 46408
a 46571
regular 47609
officer 47701
of 47978
much 48319
experience 49262
but 51303
I 51506
procured 51979
its 55652
suspension 63964
in 68343
my 72410
own 72692
command 73192
by 73870
a 74931
direct 76898
appeal 81892
to 82608
the 84345
army 84804
commander 86632
There 91976
was 92363
no 92667
more 96081
doubt 96304
then 97773
than 97925
there 98154
is 98207
to-day 98369
of 101245
the 102290
superiority 104331
of 105934
rifled 106065
guns 106624
either 108084
for 111954
long-range 113334
practice 113685
with 113715
shells 113726
or 113981
in 114058
close 114846
work 115096
with 115333
canister 115785
They 115937
were 119005
so 119018
much 122739
lighter 124651
that 125948
we 131984
could 132143
jump 132279
them 132325
across 132340
a 132394
rough 132602
country 132625
where 132850
the 133640
teams 134660
could 135585
hardly 138457
move 139596
a 144556
Napoleon 153192
We 155247
could 158695
subdue 167736
our 173647
adversaries' 173803
fire 173807
with 174461
them 175416
when 176987
their 179792
smooth-bores 180712
could 119256
not 183293
reach 16014
us 30988
Yet 43295
we 46445
were 118538
ordered 147978
to 171377
throw 10041
away 20979
our 35534
advantages 147273
and 147194
reduce 147433
ourselves 147503
to 149077
our 149343
enemy's 149400
condition 149438
upon 149460
the 149511
obstinate 155447
prejudice 156757
of 178580
a 2663
worthy 147712
man 2780
who 152814
had 2642
had 147691
all 4152
flexibility 75630
drilled 121843
out 141718
of 149168
him 149845
by 149221
routine 149813
Models 152396
of 77494
automatic 176466
rapid-fire 5128
and 3514
repeating 146283
field-pieces 163593
were 41828
familiar 136253
objects 67495
at 99816
the 110011
rear 60235
but 9957
I 62423
saw 35058
none 35963
of 167326
them 5900
in 64827
action 66608
in 97339
any 118594
army 149784
in 174534
which 5058
I 177276
served 127848
The 172237
conservatism 10742
of 144942
the 10255
old 12910
army 96770
must 120282
be 5912
held 7419
responsible 23727
for 116766
this 6515
The 45253
question 64839
of 67504
zeal 92719
and 102260
devotion 132259
to 142282
the 67682
cause 147634
for 155908
which 23720
we 97807
fought 109588
cannot 148116
be 20381
ignored 8010
in 10115
such 11323
a 12877
war 12890
as 14351
ours 14470
was 14509
It 14674
is 44299
notorious 50967
that 51368
comparatively 56934
few 57277
of 61397
the 61680
regular 61714
officers 61871
were 62320
political 70006
friends 70608
of 96724
Mr 96807
Lincoln's 137303
administration 140697
at 142155
the 167086
beginning 817
Of 9875
those 12291
who 7294
did 12298
not 62758
go 7390
with 9420
the 14116
South 14204
but 14993
remained 13910
true 60237
to 87457
the 40697
National 2383
flag 16647
some 40501
were 56033
full 72123
of 72440
earnest 97658
patriotism 114934
like 124961
the 131067
young 131787
officers 133292
whom 133858
I 33236
have 51339
mentioned 53870
as 56065
volunteering 70835
to 71307
assist 77756
the 78385
governors 81170
of 81209
States 93601
in 95946
organizing 106376
their 106442
contingents 109515
and 117842
as 124304
seeking 131207
places 136329
in 168337
volunteer 170297
regiments 171901
There 178337
were 179021
others 134987
who 135117
meant 47206
to 77313
do 22245
their 25424
duty 66464
but 79074
began 79143
with 97869
little 99324
hopefulness 111242
or 137668
zeal 161780
There 165901
were 173928
still 46277
others 15549
who 45806
did 139643
not 151117
hesitate 163793
to 30931
predict 47977
defeat 54888
and 60948
to 67325
avow 67337
that 133181
it 144782
was 146147
only 2560
for 140476
professional 29034
honor 144717
or 157010
advancement 167390
that 29186
they 26113
continued 33629
to 35450
serve 48884
under 74392
the 95289
National 95857
flag 99342
These 107805
last 110656
were 110680
confessedly 116457
soldiers 116811
of 135272
fortune 157878
The 164163
war 67690
was 177637
an 180146
education 55665
for 152009
all 8421
who 15282
were 10641
in 52255
it 15145
and 87464
many 28167
a 87465
man 11239
began 27407
with 32117
reluctance 21519
and 36832
half-heartedness 40732
who 149757
was 56249
abundantly 80688
radical 91036
before 98541
the 101235
conflict 134911
was 138749
over 151361
There 166283
was 80770
however 41761
a 104586
considerable 122227
class 3213
who 175948
practised 149323
on 155576
Talleyrand's 157293
diplomatic 140039
motto 140282
point 6869
de 13250
zele 19993
and 20094
limited 24510
their 26373
efforts 33728
to 41708
the 42954
strict 46624
requirement 46663
of 46821
duty 46886
Such 47924
men 47937
would 49086
see 49807
disaster 51033
occur 55639
for 56411
lack 56528
of 57721
a 59481
little 60032
spontaneity 60071
on 61727
their 61949
part 64688
and 66682
yet 66995
be 69213
able 70560
to 72913
show 73243
that 73735
they 77962
literally 78556
obeyed 79429
every 79665
order 85219
received 85907
I 89729
was 90565
once 92710
ordered 93497
to 101405
support 105368
with 105459
my 112410
command 113469
a 114560
movement 117862
to 118194
be 118501
made 119807
by 121744
another 124567
It 124828
was 125888
an 128300
important 128579
juncture 128624
in 129080
a 129236
campaign 129729
Wondering 130180
at 131796
delay 131930
I 133482
rode 135441
forward 136125
and 137799
found 140606
the 140672
general 142091
officer 142387
I 142598
was 142812
to 146451
support 146975
I 153916
told 156332
him 161038
I 163838
was 164991
ordered 166261
to 167279
support 172255
him 176642
in 176690
doing 178961
what 181741
we 182116
both 182453
saw 101039
was 111560
needing 128892
to 78602
be 79566
done 82622
but 82649
he 195
had 5084
no 5098
explicit 8720
orders 9116
to 9684
begin 9754
the 10667
movement 10714
I 12651
said 13667
that 24755
my 44534
orders 46793
to 54311
support 55082
him 56615
were 57604
sufficient 63516
to 63873
authorize 64475
his 70015
action 70566
and 77761
it 113523
was 141542
plain 149036
that 154923
it 156078
would 159083
be 159130
unfortunate 163693
if 2947
the 163342
thing 797
were 9855
not 1121
done 37075
at 2481
once 140397
He 1016
answered 29091
cynically 461
If 4649
you 5147
had 5174
been 7989
in 8817
the 9151
army 9517
as 10761
long 11409
as 11415
I 12539
have 12923
you 14359
would 14696
be 16950
content 21885
to 29047
do 30451
the 31999
things 32374
that 32380
are 34090
ordered 34416
without 34774
hunting 35792
up 36553
others 36912
The 40111
English 41525
regulars 42541
also 42814
have 42822
a 43555
saying 44651
Volunteering 45497
brings 46885
bad 47071
luck 48661
There 51069
was 51375
altogether 51413
too 51888
much 52032
of 52233
this 52395
spirit 52484
in 52827
the 55187
army 55886
and 56940
one 58438
who 58940
can 58946
read 59779
between 60108
the 60232
lines 61105
will 62210
see 62904
it 63004
in 65338
the 65404
history 69294
of 77786
many 79764
a 82184
campaign 82999
It 87077
did 89185
not 89358
necessarily 90866
mean 94124
wavering 94162
loyalty 95180
It 99162
was 99405
sometimes 102095
the 102403
mental 114290
indecision 116896
or 118724
timidity 118973
which 121498
shrinks 121683
from 131267
responsibility 134034
It 134178
was 135325
sometimes 135846
also 137919
the 138692
result 141643
of 143658
education 144940
in 146393
an 147785
army 147818
on 148144
the 148202
peace 148612
establishment 148627
where 149108
any 152214
spontaneity 152694
was 154399
snubbed 156110
as 156126
an 156433
impertinence 157610
or 159927
tyrannically 160376
crushed 160705
as 161486
a 162076
breach 162951
of 163115
discipline 168803
I 170642
would 170666
not 173017
be 174318
understood 176465
to 176523
make 176609
more 178014
of 181060
these 1231
things 50461
than 741
is 3316
necessary 103966
to 30377
a 42261
just 29918
estimate 75966
of 170031
the 170038
situation 184000
but 17
it 55
seems 182706
to 182718
me 183397
an 183435
entirely 182690
fair 182749
conclusion 185353
that 185364
with 185396
us 185448
in 185461
as 528
with 7849
the 9291
first 10144
French 10147
republic 10153
the 10178
infusion 11426
of 13231
the 15471
patriotic 17607
enthusiasm 18707
of 18874
a 23528
volunteer 24691
organization 37221
was 42165
a 42710
necessity 46312
and 53606
that 64766
this 72468
fully 74491
made 76824
up 76837
for 77063
lack 79168
of 81249
instruction 84633
at 85465
the 87572
start 89538
This 93451
hasty 94569
analysis 96173
of 96462
what 102313
the 104764
actual 104775
preparation 109008
for 115564
war 118616
was 126202
in 126329
the 127568
case 129190
of 129858
the 135160
average 136295
line 142265
officer 142693
of 145195
the 149054
regular 152036
army 166870
will 169995
show 172152
to 172902
some 174099
extent 181596
the 181620
basis 181654
of 183932
my 9348
judgment 9567
that 15877
there 21321
was 58600
nothing 4693
in 14140
it 64720
which 119022
a 149937
new 120392
volunteer 387
officer 5362
having 8364
what 14216
I 22271
have 60926
called 93843
military 97048
aptitude 106962
should 112912
not 114562
learn 114687
in 117937
his 140596
first 144703
campaign 144729
How 145499
far 161346
the 165770
officers 167588
of 170978
the 173117
engineers 177107
and 9115
of 11505
the 40464
staff 72250
corps 123046
applied 123329
themselves 134819
to 137075
general 162242
military 3839
study 6619
would 17438
depend 17564
upon 19557
their 23285
taste 26345
and 27653
their 30938
leisure 44725
Their 46800
opportunities 60538
for 65811
doing 67389
so 69133
were 70100
much 72090
better 77920
than 78128
those 90264
of 94332
line 100354
officers 104396
but 105297
there 111052
was 120675
also 123079
a 140814
tendency 143354
to 149558
immerse 149775
themselves 153502
in 159735
the 160143
studies 160206
of 160765
their 161112
special 161388
department 162757
of 167597
work 170418
Very 170918
eminent 171467
officers 172689
of 174386
engineers 177696
have 178114
told 1838
me 104791
since 3549
the 4770
war 9141
that 9795
the 24116
pressure 27668
of 38560
their 40238
special 44328
professional 58266
work 62867
was 66977
such 88143
that 121671

anew 161026

drawn 21663

lesson 91535
all 103818
the 106941
more 106947
telling 111324
I 112383
drew 112430
a 115232
long 115707
breath 117639
of 118193
relief 118611
and 141471
nothing 152249
which 1494
happened 1774
to 18281
me 19350
in 19863
the 24543
whole 25641
war 34238
so 36680
encouraged 37833
me 40859
to 41101
hopeful 57304
confidence 71269
in 71939
the 73786
outcome 74760
of 78655
it 79052
as 79479
the 80645
evidence 80789
I 88663
saw 89669
that 90530
our 93917
blunders 101407
at 103068
the 103796
beginning 104283
had 114941
been 115863
no 117867
greater 128620
than 150331
those 161944
of 176236
old 181215
standing 181634
armies 34566
and 80909
that 162165
our 98512
capacity 111927
to 41289
learn 7032
was 7116
at 9990
least 10994
as 11165
quick 19949
as 31823
theirs 32015
Their 35874
experience 38364
like 61284
ours 101337
showed 127139
that 129151
the 134436
personal 158513
qualities 792
of 9850
a 31869
commanding 60922
officer 61032
counted 61451
for 61536
much 63486
more 63620
than 93223
his 158276
theoretic 158490
equipment 9505
and 9583
that 58440
a 60123
bold 61039
heart 61474
a 63383
cool 63438
head 101322
and 102326
practical 127112
common-sense 1381
were 56760
of 15048
much 11954
more 25740
importance 90475
than 113330
anything 130735
taught 141528
at 172455
school 130817
With 61323
these 16846
a 22893
brief 87791
experience 136556
would 146831
enable 27319
an 142128
intelligent 3671
man 60142
to 143918
fill 4472
nearly 57107
any 140839
subordinate 149537
position 149582
with 7651
fair 8663
success 14045
without 14262
them 22609
any 32414
responsibility 54298
of 57061
a 57452
warlike 160507
kind 182345
would 182364
prove 5267
too 57811
heavy 12437
for 14066
him 76216
The 7247
supreme 37139
qualification 58625
of 152393
a 83268
general-in-chief 75727
is 144761
the 42340
power 84367
to 86702
estimate 112643
truly 124369
and 444
grasp 693
clearly 6016
the 23856
situation 24943
on 25599
a 26044
field 29999
of 31597
operations 31968
too 35019
large 36221
to 38795
be 39080

by 42427
the 44842
physical 45258
eye 45439

the 55199
great 57600
task 59341
of 60402
his 61063
military 61930
life 63803
was 67618
trying 71933
to 73683
make 81592
out 85088
what 85604
was 88098
behind 99945
the 105035
hill 109061
and 109072
the 109252
undaunted 110442
temper 114350
of 117455
will 118272
which 122908
enables 123263
him 124776
to 124844
execute 129952
with 132456
persistent 133933
vigor 138351
the 145692
plan 146361
which 147336
his 156868

approves 162212
To 164681

upon 167898
uncertainties 173731

it 2789
in 5548
the 15819
midst 28954
of 147710
carnage 148600
and 149058
death 149075

immeasurable 149811

hang 63901
upon 153253
it 128120
--this 100940
is 103777
the 65155
supreme 88139
presence 70823
of 184823
mind 32289
which 46361
marks 8871
a 20245

which 18634
is 22847

The 137334
problem 138322
itself 138957
is 151822
usually 159231
simple 165422

overwhelming 60676
situation 115860
under 167783

that 74601
causes 124799
timidity 181262

It 43160
is 43791
the 75302

the 24712
fearful 26408
consequences 93148
of 101186

this 170093

With 154425
it 155607

be 17696
doubly 34802

Forrest 47592
may 117165
far 87984
outshine 137914
him 178938
as 179096
a 57716
soldier 132709
Nor 51219
does 162679
success 78597
as 179436

subordinate 152642
give 32178
any 68635
certain 5230
assurance 26623
of 28700
fitness 49514
for 52458
supreme 57732
command 59776
Napoleon's 71456
marshals 84422
generally 93211
failed 93647
when 93769
trusted 107555
with 110961
an 118102
independent 131688
command 145753
as 147210
Hooker 151347
did 161761
with 4923
us 64464
and 75301
I 94190
do 97889
not 105330
doubt 167371
that 177034
many 178263
men 180013
like 30232
McClellan 39540
who 1114
failed 37068
as 106870
generals-in-chief 6465
would 7972
have 9157
made 10290
brave 17026
and 77068
good 164190
subordinates 5453
The 6063
test 8011
of 15560
quality 22006
is 23342
different 64920
in 69194
kind 88289
and 142154
as 172377
I 184263
have 185107
said 185110
the 7446
only 134868
proof 136430
of 137725
its 161922
possession 162459
is 174910
in 8173
the 22785
actual 136208
trial 15042
It 65586
is 130200
safe 153226
to 172786
say 135841
that 40711
a 85270
timid 113439
subordinate 113034
will 22201
not 45139
be 59158
a 73657
good 110169
commander 118364
but 118545
it 120954
cannot 124099
be 129606
affirmed 170535
that 177868
a 652
bold 13592
one 22408
will 26714
though 121692
there 146815
are 184233
more 40520
chances 55362
in 55648
his 78038
favor 80019
The 84622
education 85228
of 140057
peril 149472
is 149592
so 158434
powerful 168936
in 169364
bringing 171849
out 21055
the 45502
qualities 55403
that 83775
can 108100
master 138799
it 167569
and 168694
for 168862
any 181174
one 45537
who 42516
has 72521
true 76704
military 81824
courage 82823
the 82935
acquirement 91870
of 91921
skill 122647
in 168260
the 174431
more 52056
mechanical 52000
part 54108
of 5668
his 9586
duty 11912
in 27875
war 31840
is 32368
so 32936
rapid 52303
that 56866
my 62460
experience 75270
has 89186
led 152066
me 157046
to 157911
reckon 159137
low 167155
in 182150
the 182757
comparison 145069
the 91373
value 124465
of 57282
the 58206
knowledge 58236
a 59425
soldier 65160
gains 65375
in 121539
times 174194
of 61426
peace 85208
I 124491
say 146520
in 167224
the 180623
comparison 55994
Tactics 149206
are 177143
essential 6900
to 11424
the 37210
handling 44092
of 51185
large 79733
bodies 92696
of 95283
men 113288
and 134557
must 139048
be 139352
learned 140515
But 142247
the 142360
zealous 153329
young 154198
soldier 155021
with 156967
aptitude 174527
for 112337
his 29440
work 82017
will 26495
learn 63236
this 65647
part 147769
of 150420
his 64602
duty 57646
so 61207
fast 19026
that 35409
a 39573
single 59358
campaign 59818
will 60989
find 63270
him 64985
abreast 85368
of 85387
any 89265
At 123958
the 138872
beginning 160980
of 173951
a 179618
great 47292
war 68017
and 72380
in 85188
the 89077
organization 118373
of 132764
a 136283
great 6458
army 6878
the 85234
knowledge 123727
of 176088
routine 756
and 3331
of 6486
details 98962
undoubtedly 63897
saves 64415
time 64427
and 2556
saves 11373
cost 23051
both 62277
of 63492
treasure 74122
and 82569
of 84273
life 84933
I 85392
am 96448
therefore 112300
far 128942
from 136688
arguing 140472
that 141137
the 141193
knowledge 141380
which 141513
was 143283
found 153342
in 156033
the 166075
regular 167791
army 168797
should 178652
not 64039
be 84
made 131339
the 101876
most 20131
of 20874
I 90231
have 93842
already 133210
said 178873
that 2323
it 131007
should 132476
have 54518
been 168200
scattered 168492
through 46458
the 132239
whole 3415
volunteer 6345
organization 7268
So 10631
I 12970
also 15083
say 15648
that 15684
it 17879
was 21495
quite 28220
right 29259
to 31545
look 35191
for 39671
the 41949
higher 43098
qualities 43616
for 44423
command 45288
in 50324
those 52432
who 56025
had 56492
the 57473
technical 61175
information 61841
and 62369
skill 63463
But 64215
I 65093
reckon 65560
patriotic 71075
zeal 71852
and 75205
devotion 79624
so 81976
high 83522
that 86216
I 87911
have 88163
no 88307
hesitation 89659
in 94230
adding 94806
that 96580
our 96798
army 97806
as 99062
a 107696
whole 110999
would 114359
have 115524
been 115587
improved 117987
if 118132
the 119167
distinction 120826
between 122448
regular 122965
and 123741
volunteer 125074
had 125289
been 125485
abolished 128121
and 129892
after 130112
the 130435
first 147431
beginnings 147899
a 151389
freer 153050
competition 153404
for 159574
even 169070
the 169172
highest 169342
commands 174246
had 176460
been 178084
open 178213
to 179362
all 180375
To 183019
keep 144746
up 1804
the 1814
regular 5020
army 7283
organization 8312
was 10241
practically 12027
to 12914
say 15197
that 19236
a 20036
captaincy 20119
in 20476
it 20936
was 22809
equivalent 22825
to 24092
a 24695
brigade 24727
command 25529
in 26096
the 28155
volunteers 30825
and 34076
to 39616
be 41528
a 42507
brigadier 43430
in 43499
it 44374
was 47389
a 49338
reward 49541
which 49620
regular 49668
officers 72269
looked 72776
forward 73290
to 76983
as 77047
a 77840
result 77997
of 79535
the 79798
successful 80801
conduct 80896
of 86745
a 89768
great 90481
campaign 90589
as 92216
general-in-chief 92712
of 93964
an 94484
army 98395
The 98494
actual 99572
command 99582
in 101041
war 103619
was 103809
thus 104272
ridiculously 105449
belittled 108432
in 111562
the 117527
official 127642
scale 127760
in 128894
comparison 128903
with 131187
grades 133666
of 134181
a 134355
petty 138414
peace 139753
establishment 151125
and 163493
the 165400
climax 167039
of 168079
absurdity 169792
was 42980
reached 149786
when 52843

worthily 15852
commanded 21180

corps 80402
found 83370
themselves 98530
reduced 110837
to 113514
subordinate 128232
places 131355

early 177282
in 177331

that 179323

His 123613
information 157717

him 59536
to 61521
believe 100923
that 100986
the 110405

Rosecrans 184924

uniting 125284
his 125666
columns 49142
for 43637
further 46470
work 73226
He 96271
asked 110969
for 170903
reinforcements 88234
to 55071
the 10862
extent 23903
of 125287

to 64126
enable 69112
him 73580
to 75426
perform 156214
his 64028
task 65702
The 113118
use 139123
of 146204
pack 146720
trains 10846
was 50432
given 80460
up 119096
as 128241
they 149522
required 155189
a 174207
greater 5401
number 14434
of 31579
animals 76630
than 162864
could 175218
be 130152
procured 170636
In 184785
fact 125809
it 12534

upon 14196
which 16093
wheel 16983
vehicles 19925
could 25906
be 27435
used 28017
A 28875
rapid 33340
cavalry 34385
raid 34709
could 35608
be 40080
thus 41345
supplied 44033
but 47747
heavy 49611
columns 67000
of 68480
infantry 70913
and 72290
artillery 77752
demanded 77827
wagon 83379
trains 88953
The 101937
weakness 104344
of 115756
Rosecrans's 124129
scheme 135359
is 137529
found 163041
in 45049
the 71361
wide 73199
separation 78248
of 82508
parallel 96346
columns 131508
which 147190
could 87557
never 149758
have 22004
co-operated 16810
with 29674
success 40734
and 60289
which 60321
had 126350

had 164386
success 164794
been 169310
possible 170108
To 174340
be 922
sure 21757
it 30527
was 141119
presumed 141157
that 141627
McClellan 163807
with 169528
the 180892
Army 2905
of 157576
the 184181
Potomac 7704
and 158293
Banks 5431
in 11700
the 29853
Shenandoah 55966
valley 98568
would 162153
be 183766
operating 169037
in 184317
eastern 184701
Virginia 147300
but 177
as 6103
McClellan 7727
was 8762
already 9803
bent 10945
on 12044
making 14549
Chesapeake 24163
Bay 25814
his 27323
base 27460
and 27516
keeping 32084
as 41721
far 42929
as 43519
possible 50283
from 56410
the 58213
mountains 59843
there 59919
was 60103
no 62180
real 62646
connection 64579
or 64687
correlation 64901
between 64946
his 65346
purposed 70330
campaign 73607
and 74674
that 80390
of 84616
the 86410
others 100113
Indeed 121069
had 122760
he 123702
succeeded 124787
in 131696
driving 133826
Lee 138657
from 139766
Richmond 140235
toward 141676
the 146713
west 152111
as 162177
Grant 176124
did 1358
three 56737
years 21308
later 22141
the 107259
feeble 136614
columns 15520
of 90970
National 114994
troops 30459
coming 48478
from 75351
West 150990
Virginia 61301
would 1387
necessarily 56766
have 27206
fallen 148161
back 37141
again 27570
before 42835
the 96549
enemy 113047
If 19914
the 44490

had 79924
been 94068
planned 94142
by 98310
Lee 133715
himself 135195
it 177561
could 179700
not 145791
have 168819
secured 170523
for 40153
him 44855
more 53208
perfectly 55051
the 75499
advantage 89704
of 118422
interior 130135

Yet 172595
it 179665
was 184424
in 184450
substance 129012
that 11661
which 27873
was 38465
tried 63096
when 99026

Washington 94310
McClellan 88379

taken 30400
the 111636
field 112538
and 183776
President 38905
Lincoln 43149
had 48372
made 68794
use 73053
of 76033
the 96186
occasion 100039
to 104946
relieve 105814
him 106014
from 106198
the 110480
direction 111567
of 114268
all 115726
other 117430
forces 111688
so 114232
that 5380
he 13345
might 30796
give 43639
undivided 44150
attention 47179
to 121501

for 5600

I 14155
have 16617
already 20018
pointed 22312
out 24132
extensive 24190
military 25174
operations 25760

beyond 27895
the 33883
Alleghanies 37569
from 42011
west 43003
or 44979
east 45028
were 47907
impracticable 49628
because 51591
a 53369
wilderness 55220
a 55534
hundred 56082
miles 58228
wide 60508
crossed 61010
by 61277

and 62019
most 64446
difficult 66319
roads 73241
rendered 80749
it 83060

He 117856
was 117941
a 118295
rigid 118358
disciplinarian 118387
and 118432
his 118486
own 118531
regiment 118723
was 118861
a 119509
model 119665
of 119671
accuracy 120038
in 120271
drill 120455

greatly 121939

square 123147
head 123161
with 123199
dark 123296
smooth-shaven 123380
face 123386
and 123393
rather 123463
stern 123554
expression 123620
inspired 123858
his 123868
troops 123880
with 123887
something 123995
very 124059
like 124078
awe 124385
insuring 124750
prompt 124780
obedience 125363

his 125796

At 126016
home 126471
in 126518
Cincinnati 126735
he 126836
was 126991
a 127040

influence 127254
among 127269
the 127345

him 130091

satisfactory 130834

an 132829
officer 132981

had 133776
taken 133980
early 133988
advantage 134038
of 134123
the 134173
relaxation 134227

hair 136927
and 137019
sandy 137190
beard 137243
his 137638
manner 137705
was 137789
rather 138178
diffident 138249

shy 138569
and 138594
his 138630
whole 138691
style 138813
quiet 138828
and 138976
reticent 139107
His 139173
voice 139211
was 139250
light 139254
rather 139474
than 139520
heavy 139756
and 140326
he 140440
was 140626
so 141154
laconic 141475
of 141621
speech 141828
that 141964
this 142056
with 142422
his 142471
other 142507
characteristics 142575
caused 142612
it 142702
to 142844
be 142865
commonly 142908
said 143125
of 143220
him 143384
that 143476
he 143868
had 143965
been 143974
so 143977
long 143983
fighting 144005
Indians 144021
on 144140
the 144197
frontier 144273
that 144354
he 144436
had 144446
acquired 144456
some 144484
of 144537
their 144624
traits 145482
and 145648
habits 145712
His 145947
system 146019
of 146200
discipline 146334
was 146510
based 146587
on 146685
these 147038
peculiarities 147192
He 147304
aimed 147311
at 147339
a 147410
stoical 147430
command 147501
of 147605
himself 147657
as 147918
the 147960
means 148036
of 148057
commanding 148140
others 148218
and 148253
avoided 148313
noisy 148387
bluster 148437
of 148475
every 148760
sort 148924
going 148935
perhaps 149078
to 149100
an 149211
excess 149219
in 149230
brevity 149277
of 149287
speech 149358
and 149476
in 149729
enforcing 149823
his 149851
orders 149923
by 150061
the 150080
consequences 150254
of 150477
any 150663
disobedience 150690
His 151431
subordinates 151720
recognized 151755
his 151772
purpose 151830
to 151895
be 152035
just 152068
and 152084
soon 152171
learned 152476
to 152768
have 152797
the 152940

a 153547
military 153567
officer 153639
Unless 153716
common 153781
fame 153940
did 153981
him 153992
injustice 154007
he 154154
was 154189
one 154219
of 154256
those 154337
officers 154468
who 154558

sympathy 155354
with 155456
the 155644
National 155683

had 156073
no 156113

the 156931
success 157002

a 157838

and 158259
an 158311
ambitious 158347

Virginians 5635
whose 13402
standing 16172

made 18222
him 18547
naturally 18878
prominent 19028
among 19360
his 20661
people 21053
He 21121
was 21655
a 21841
worthy 23355
man 23377
and 23400
an 23433
honorable 23958
officer 24797

knowledge 25102
of 25478
the 26118
country 26323

of 26771
the 26841
people 29438
made 32356
him 32640
a 32705
fit 32712
selection 32727
to 32813
preserve 33276
the 33740

thus 41503
separated 43838
him 44082

town 101289
we 101471
deployed 102251
skirmishers 102566
in 102680
front 102840
though 103532
they 103913
were 103957
obliged 104962
to 105433
move 105456
slowly 105607
in 105679
the 105737

Day 106125
was 106398
just 106613
breaking 106819
as 108996
we 109110
came 109242
out 109284
of 109305
the 109337
forest 109819
upon 109866
the 109960
clearing 110289
line 111216

and 114152
the 114348
troops 114463
went 114795
forward 115079
cheering 115248
The 115254
enemy 116354
made 116629
no 116727
stubborn 116807
resistance 116941
but 117190
retired 117579
gradually 119221
to 122552
a 129640
strong 133040
position 137508
on 137876
rough 138017
wooded 139356
hills 139385
about 142281
a 142463
mile 152192
from 158971
the 164076
village 164670
where 164934
they 165054
covered 166703
both 167422
the 169886
Wytheville 172063
and 176703
the 177374
Wyoming 178796
road 178866
They 178989
had 179330
artillery 179946
on 180620
both 731
flanks 3306
and 3190
could 175925
only 110151
be 6976
reached 9560
over 50589
open 59913
and 60110
exposed 60798
ground 61264
We 62203
recovered 62400
our 64153
headquarters 70178
tents 87528
standing 144757
as 147822
we 150898
had 174049
left 142651
them 156487
We 62472
had 123391
captured 78955
a 92587
few 54441
prisoners 54599
and 54925
learned 1263
that 50493
Marshall 54480
and 78866
Williams 175509
were 59765
both 443
before 4584
us 6200

Lieutenant-Colonel 15514
Von 17663
Blessingh 25511
with 39086
the 39179
ten 40909
companies 42855
of 45265
Moor's 52650
brigade 52735
approached 53463
on 54020
the 58936
Wytheville 59510
road 62006
and 62865
attacked 63747
but 63768
the 63828
enemy 85474
was 92179
aware 93712
of 95685
their 104759
approach 105585
and 110904
repulsed 113299
them 114696
having 114973
placed 130131
a 131994
detachment 137587
in 140165
a 142903
very 147628
strong 147943
position 152684
to 154492
meet 155753
them 156705
Von 157269
Blessingh 161364
withdrew 162436
his 162446
men 164898
and 171404
later 172568
joined 175262
the 175709
command 176686
by 178127
a 179658
considerable 183024
detour 183227
With 183355
less 183622
than 183684
two 183806
regiments 183984
in 184016
hand 184063
and 184963
with 79757
the 150569
certainty 5410
of 5730
the 6130
enemy's 23388
great 34708
superiority 40661
there 45611
was 45976
nothing 52329
for 54155
it 55680
but 57026
to 57731
take 59427
the 59797
best 63309
position 68910
we 74043
could 79181
and 82459
await 92443
Scammon's 94888
arrival 103003
We 104010
made 109120
as 121782
strong 124425
a 124714
show 125571
of 131478
force 137602
as 139998
possible 150088
and 155904
by 156966
skirmishing 159339
advances 175210
tempted 178630
the 46051
enemy 34680
to 130784
come 121291
down 121532
to 184949
attack 134899
but 52072
he 58050
also 135867
was 150823
expecting 135709
reinforcements 15123
and 52467
a 41747
little 41825

frequent 79028

I 91210
fell 93098
asleep 93994
and 95058
had 95884
a 97862
short 98241
but 99446
refreshing 99683
nap 102451
almost 103955
within 104057

Toward 111413
evening 111740
Scammon 111788
arrived 112726
with 113055
his 113091
brigade 114666
reporting 115348
that 117289
Heth's 128873
force 132805
had 134922
followed 136981
his 137847
retiring 138127
movement 138265
as 138480
far 138631
as 138644
French's 138830
and 141667
confirming 154692
the 156974
information 156979
that 157410
four 160097
brigades 160126
of 160825
the 161017
enemy 161036
were 166011
before 166362
us 167319
Shortly 168457
after 170250
dark 171598
the 171743
officer 172050
of 174197
the 174334
day 174682
on 174876
the 175343
right 175905
reported 182018
the 184521
noise 47289
of 74688
artillery 3132
marching 10717
around 25853
that 38049
flank 56199
Our 142974
last 146335
day's 149275
rations 169638
had 183059
been 184852
issued 184857
and 9469
our 141479
animals 20008
were 20099
without 28522
forage 35266
Small 46519
parties 85636
of 96686
the 97665
enemy 99513
had 108125
gone 113582
far 115746
to 127424
our 161446
rear 170403
and 111087
cut 136689
the 65363
telegraph 172678
so 10548
that 79541
we 9378
had 95826
had 96025
no 106673
news 116207
from 141280
the 95787
Kanawha 99238
valley 111241
for 115106
two 91867
days 92420
The 45461
interruption 72799
was 80095
likely 94541
to 109686
create 91364
disturbance 35119
there 45471
and 132033
derange 1156
all 44668
our 18392
plans 30191
for 36126
supply 36320
It 93186
was 94434
plain 94518
that 95011
we 95094
should 95570
have 95957
to 96084
be 97782
content 100445
with 106666
having 116993
foiled 117832
the 125492
enemy's 125494
plan 167771
to 173706
inflict 2089
a 111452
severe 68686
blow 93253
upon 99908
us 112018
and 174703
that 7424
we 30689
might 105923
congratulate 106618
ourselves 1858
that 104811
with 3109
two 29755
brigades 30601
against 34970
four 47408
we 62192
had 62417
regained 64154
our 80050
line 93815
without 131406
serious 150899
loss 166999
I 168103
therefore 169615
ordered 173790
that 173830
the 179089
troops 3017
be 43754
allowed 69602
to 163412
rest 51071
till 133623
three 3222
o'clock 20428

then 163001
retire 166784
behind 173054
the 173102
Blue-stone 175957
River 84956
The 8593

a 30980

Flat-top 81932
Mountain 167745

the 80481

on 135943
every 4605
side 7399
were 61046
well 160326
guarded 130625

all 38980

in 40140
the 42145

about 43196
Princeton 44428
had 50674
been 50853
only 51408
as 51471
the 52189
enemy 52399
had 54937
not 56336
delivered 65956
any 76957
serious 77981
attack 81955
and 88509
the 95317
contest 97971
on 98869
our 101601
side 106150
had 107779
been 110205
one 112743
of 112956
manoeuvre 113504
in 116408
which 117542
our 119177
only 120749
chance 121239
of 121995
important 122890
results 122986
was 124365
in 124374
attacking 125486
either 128491
Heth 129907
or 130640
Marshall 130681
when 132274
they 133902
were 135723
so 135996
far 138891
separated 139574
that 140187
they 142105
could 142467
not 143638
unite 143644
against 146495
us 146853
on 150558
the 150562
field 151268
of 156924
battle 158403
After 159552
the 160936
15th 161867
this 162203
chance 162908
did 163707
not 164953
exist 167330
and 169856
wisdom 170577
dictated 170704
that 172128
we 175160
should 177095
retire 177580
to 177913
a 179219
safe 182461
point 163624
from 185049
which 64414
we 257
could 597
watch 2501
for 2578
contingencies 3147
which 6502
might 7084
give 9994
us 10033
a 10121
better 11148
opportunity 11210
Our 12354
experience 15010
proved 16126
what 18625
I 21277
have 24542
before 24554
stated 28493
that 28630
the 31667
facility 32577
for 38056
railway 38952
concentration 39331
of 41473
the 43214
enemy 44471
in 44515
our 44883
front 45262
made 45453
this 45661
line 50219
a 51291
useless 53007
one 54564
for 55298
aggressive 57554
movements 58833
as 59080
they 59247
could 59611
always 60743
concentrate 63066
a 63392
superior 63865
force 66498
after 66942
they 67572
received 70827
the 72259
news 75919
of 78903
our 78943
being 79596
in 80637
motion 81927
It 84446
also 85564
showed 86874
the 87522
error 87951
of 88325
dividing 90670
my 93916
forces 93936
on 97447
two 97650
lines 100117
for 100898
had 101102
Crook's 101350

been 102383
with 102677
me 103067
or 104282
my 108833
two 109059
brigades 110834
with 112398
him 112654
we 112884
should 113604
have 118158
felt 119592
strong 120383
enough 121254
to 121268
cope 121305
with 121450
the 121730
force 121915
which 121972
was 122467
actually 122753
in 123086
our 124617
front 124772
and 125970
would 126010
at 126892
least 127918
have 128114
made 128144
it 128878
necessary 128983
for 129041
the 129056
enemy 129123
to 129217

still 129315

a 143632
little 144152
one 144232
very 146450

the 148691
character 148900
of 149053
the 149214
subordinate 150317
movements 150463
so 150537
often 151190
attempted 151753
during 153976
the 154807
war 157228
and 157947
shows 159345
that 159663
the 159817
same 159859
principles 159934
of 162531
strategy 163708
are 164620
found 166840
operating 169848
as 171374
in 173001
great 175882

except 28135
one 28918
baggage-wagon 31543
which 32512

At 46893
the 47075

which 98303
our 109335

be 124905
turned 126704
and 129227
we 131220
halted 131976
there 133341
as 138583
the 140646
end 146840

the 149597

which 22559

the 43280

the 64375

see 38
the 293
humorous 446
application 3526
of 4356
any 5649
such 6018
incident 6760
greeted 7214
it 11037
with 11043
cheers 15629
and 21240
laughter 22469
All 33185
felt 33965
that 39804
we 40806
were 46046
again 47158
masters 53423
of 53740
the 55048
situation 55798
Next 56326
day 57350
we 57911
moved 59257
leisurely 65200
to 66570
the 72089
mountain 72305
summit 73601
a 77366
broad 81637
undulating 82131
table-land 84072
with 84334
some 87086
cultivated 92176
farms 96013
where 98525
our 109074
camp 110421
was 112096
perfectly 115198
hidden 118431
from 120211
sight 123101
whilst 124064
we 124955
commanded 127231
a 127489

scouring 178578
the 180861
country 181776

fully 5846
informed 6163
of 6640
everything 10124
occurring 13626
near 16083

We 21263
had 22202
time 22215
to 25575
organize 26492
the 27802
new 28045

which 45872
were 48541
beginning 58753

reach 60606
us 66304
and 66857
while 67779
waiting 68206
till 70671
Fremont 74143
could 76546
plan 81060
new 82763
co-operative 83016

to 86077
prepare 86778
for 87197
our 87828

in 90761
such 94654
work 98199
The 101007
camp 101359

Flat-top 104406
Mountain 107060

the 110821

name 54774
of 54865
the 61610

indicates 86376
its 89475
character 90850
The 90967
northern 109728
slope 113368
is 119378
gentle 119897

is 30991
broken 115153
into 40944
rounded 168967

which 8590
covered 144687
the 15131

whilst 75305
they 105159

which 25571

were 25786
drafted 25799

in 26170

of 26327
Mr 26377
Stanton 26709
the 26984
Secretary 27011
of 27078
War 27210
He 27273
admitted 27326
that 27349
some 27368
things 27609
in 27663
them 27699
were 27769
not 27783
quite 27878
in 28113
good 28194
taste 28200
but 28218
the 28281
feeling 28309
was 28631
that 28652
it 28723
was 28745
desirable 28869
to 28873
infuse 28908
vigor 28955
into 29471
the 29509
army 29727
by 29905
stirring 30181
words 30275
which 30545
would 30555
by 30610
implication 30625
condemn 30723
McClellan's 30730
policy 30748
of 30777
over-caution 30857
in 30891
military 31061
matters 31067
and 31074
over-tenderness 31082
toward 31434
rebel 31459
sympathizers 31531
and 31675
their 31814
property 31830
The 31973
Secretary 32091
as 32388
he 32412
said 32522
urged 32545
such 32552
public 32677
declarations 32975
so 33045
strongly 33049
that 33082
he 33295
did 33339
not 33390
feel 33504
at 33881
liberty 33892
to 33895
resist 33905
They 33926
were 34000
unfairly 34189
criticised 34194
and 34251
were 34260
made 34279
the 34295
occasion 34412
of 34499
a 34545
bitter 34562
and 34660
lasting 34720
enmity 34788
toward 34833
Pope 34849
on 35041

part 35343

men 36315
of 36323
the 36340
Potomac 36598
Army 36613
It 36640
seems 36769
that 36785
Mr 36794
Lincoln 36942
hesitated 36953
to 36983
approve 37096
the 37201
one 37209
relating 37428
to 37543
the 37618
arrest 37630
of 37645
disloyal 37674
persons 37678
within 37695
the 37745
lines 37806
of 37960
the 37971
army 37990
and 38090
it 38140
was 38201
not 38367
till 38396
Pope 38414
repeated 38441
his 38510
sense 38611
of 38618
the 38640
need 38647
of 38714
it 38792
that 38864
the 38890
President 38936
yielded 39324
on 39520
condition 39810
that 40016
it 40025
should 40174
be 40193
applied 40336
in 40374
exceptional 40383
cases 40393
only 40438
It 40447
was 40476
probably 40585
intended 40593
more 40634
to 40646
terrify 40690
citizens 40781
from 40821

replied 65564
that 65663
it 65680
was 65701
too 65809
much 66121
exposed 66136

Pope 66932
very 66992

short 79878

take 86432
fifteen 86739
days 86944

uninterrupted 86999

it 82112
This 82114

followed 86609

to 168256
reminiscences 168490

the 171460
preceding 171702

the 176019

case 5356

McClellan 5941
had 6105
received 6109
me 6520
at 6595
Alexandria 6609
on 6719
the 6725
27th 8054
with 8396
all 8404
his 8592
old 8761
cordiality 9140
and 9145
had 9150
put 9288
me 9383
at 9400
once 9433
upon 9439
our 9465
accustomed 9474
footing 9547
of 9611
personal 9649
friendship 9740
On 10007
my 11087
part 11127
there 11161
was 11561
naturally 11581
a 11597
little 11600
watchfulness 11614
not 11652
to 11668
overstep 11702
the 11780
proper 11885
line 11892

subordination 11950
or 11958
to 11965
be 12039
inquisitive 12215
about 12234
things 12361
he 12504
did 12579
not 13009
choose 13014
to 13017
confide 13138
to 14174
me 14249
but 14574
this 14630
being 14755
assumed 14763
I 14797
found 15018
myself 15046
in 15049
a 15079
circle 15343
where 15490
he 15550
seemed 15654
to 15694
unbosom 15899
himself 16654
with 16734
freedom 16738
I 16977
saw 17095
no 17253
interruption 17258
in 17317
this 17395
while 17414
I 17472
remained 17674
in 18221
the 18228
Potomac 18280
Army 18494
He 18546
was 18611
at 18628
this 18663
time 18719
a 18957
little 18968
depressed 19078
in 19112
manner 19158
feeling 19171
keenly 19220
his 19272
loss 19349
of 19396
power 19408
and 19422
command 19532
but 19616
maintaining 19730
a 19756
quiet 19801
dignity 19873
that 19936
became 19948
him 20022
better 20030
than 20053
any 20062
show 20132
of 20171
carelessness 20175
would 20224
have 20341
done 20374
He 20391
used 20502
no 20574
bitter 20602
or 20608
harsh 20683
language 20820
in 20824
criticising 20875
others 20908
Pope 20929
and 20992
McDowell 21004
he 21280
plainly 21289
disliked 21292
and 21344
rated 21389
them 21394
low 21492
as 21496
to 21543
capacity 21583
for 21599
command 21653
but 21660
he 21711
spoke 22191
of 22497
them 22880
without 22997
discourtesy 23005
or 23399
vilification 23432
I 24221
think 24271
it 24327
necessary 25157
to 25184
say 25429
this 25524
because 26017
of 26843
the 26959
curious 27419
sidelight 27437
thrown 27671
on 28296

Own 31432
Story 31445
and 31715
of 31976
which 32030
I 32691
shall 32703
have 32856
more 33226
to 33299
say 33313
Their 33388
inconsistency 33435
with 33691
his 33812
expressions 33839
and 33845
manner 34027
in 34080
conversation 34083
or 34102
at 34167
least 34209
their 34217
great 34331
exaggeration 34341
of 34373
what 34415
he 34490
conveyed 34521
in 35174
familiar 35467
talk 35627
has 35640
struck 35674
me 35684
very 35863
forcibly 35940
and 35949
unpleasantly 35964
He 36592
discussed 36652
his 36780
campaign 36804
of 36949
the 37156
peninsula 37264
with 37268
apparent 37333
unreserve 37376
He 37477
condemned 37501
the 37553
decision 37609
to 37637
recall 37698
him 37712
from 37732
Harrison's 37870
Landing 37933
arguing 37957
that 38027
the 38061
one 38128
thing 38173
to 38353
do 38361
in 38445
that 38458
emergency 38464
was 38484
to 38489
reinforce 38520
his 38542
army 38585
there 38594
and 38767
make 38786
it 38837
strong 38841
enough 38853
to 38873
go 38990
on 39014
with 39026
its 39052
work 39156
and 39175
capture 39190
Richmond 39209
He 39283
said 39413
that 39458
if 39463
the 39474
government 39494
had 39510
lost 39834
confidence 39920
in 39970
his 39973
ability 39994
to 40035
conduct 40066
the 40240
campaign 40403
to 40528
a 40621
successful 40753
end 41097
still 41203
it 41241
was 41294
unwise 41301
to 41324
think 41446
of 42046
anything 42094
else 42114
except 42198
to 42368
strengthen 42877
that 42928
army 42962
and 42971
give 42987
it 42993
to 43109
some 43237
one 43357
they 43712
could 43717
trust 43771
He 43837
added 43898
explicitly 43927
If 44017
Pope 44093
was 44136
the 44139
man 44332
they 44335
had 44401
faith 44533
in 44587
then 44889
Pope 44896
should 44912
have 44966
been 44995
sent 45136
to 45271
Harrison's 45534
Landing 45564
to 45574
take 45757
command 45869
and 45899
however 45915
bitter 46070
it 46080
would 46118
have 46884
been 46890
I 47105
should 47323
have 47354
had 47607
no 47669
just 48020
reason 48334
to 48367
complain 48386
He 49031
predicted 49759
that 49800
they 49836
would 49894
yet 49923
be 50000
put 50321
to 50544
the 50577
cost 50591
of 50604
much 50620
life 50805
and 50822
treasure 51231
to 51476
get 51763
back 51895
to 52122
the 52193
position 52237
left 52954
by 53170
him 53214
On 53370
Monday 53375
September 53397
1st 53631
he 53643
visited 53647
me 53746
again 54089
and 54152
we 54573
renewed 54746
our 54798
riding 54816
and 54960
our 55186
conversation 55228
The 55240
road 55277
from 55332
his 55352
headquarters 55375
encampment 55398
near 55493
Alexandria 55635
to 55650
Upton's 55659
Hill 55667
was 55670
a 55825
pleasant 56370
one 56386
for 56976
his 57611
constitutional 57796
ride 57802
and 57838
my 57885
position 57981
was 58002
nearest 59048
the 59547
army 59571
in 59692
front 59737
where 59763
news 59772
from 59785
it 60208
would 60526
most 60537
likely 60934
be 61116
first 61135
found 61144
The 61223
Army 61637
of 61782
the 63114
Potomac 63374
had 63712
all 63961
passed 63966
to 64168
the 64818
front 64829
from 64918
Alexandria 65015
and 65045
according 65172
to 65300
the 65337
letter 65396
of 65403
the 65905
orders 65957
issued 66108
he 66243
was 66267
wholly 66296
without 66432
command 66451
though 66537
Halleck 66574
personally 66680
directed 66870
him 66899
to 66906
exercise 67017
supervision 67024
over 67877
all 67911
detachments 68055
about 68161
the 68439
works 68475
and 68501
lines 68534
He 68653
came 68669
almost 68676
alone 68763
on 68843
these 68865
visits 68912
an 68956
aide 68989
and 69027
an 69103
orderly 69152
or 69997
two 70021
being 70025
his 70037
only 70048
escort 70065
Colonel 70126
Colburn 70134
of 70157
his 70231
staff 70242
was 70329
usually 70364
his 70371
companion 70403
He 70409
wore 70455
a 70468
blue 70524
flannel 70565
hunting-shirt 70681
quite 71386
different 71756
from 72366
the 72430
common 72919
army 73129
blouse 73294
It 73302
was 74394
made 74427
with 74547
a 74560
broad 74587
yoke 74595
at 74627
the 74635
neck 74801
and 74917
belt 75051
at 75055
the 75070
waist 75417
the 75440
body 75485
in 75554
plaits 75564
He 75576
was 75579
without 75774
sash 75845
or 77193
side 77508
arms 77823
or 77898
any 78346
insignia 78477
of 78543
rank 78741
except 78752
inconspicuous 78762
shoulder-straps 78840
On 78880
this 78908
day 78919
he 78934
was 79063
going 79077
into 79092
Washington 79144
and 79195
I 79206
rode 79490
down 79646
with 79734
him 79817
to 79869
the 80540
bridge 80851
Bodies 81335
of 81425
troops 81496
of 81503
the 81511
new 81526
levies 81554
were 81585
encamped 81612
at 81729
different 81742
points 81822
near 81828
the 81832
river 81956
In 81963
these 81991
there 82063
seemed 82067
to 82078
be 82141
always 82180
some 82297
veterans 82332
or 82424
officers 82436
who 82748
knew 82809
the 82822
general 82856
and 82879
the 82926
men 82969
quickly 83287
gathered 83322
in 83540
groups 83587
and 83835
cheered 83928
him 83946
He 83998
had 84004
a 84014
taking 84054
way 84069
of 84077
returning 84104
such 84248
salutations 84263
He 84580
went 84660
beyond 85179
the 85339
formal 85549
military 85569
salute 85574
and 85582
gave 85684
his 85693
cap 85713
a 85754
little 85809
twirl 85829
which 85873
with 85897
his 85962
bow 86137
and 86188
smile 86240
seemed 86263
to 86283
carry 86299
a 86306
little 86320
of 86336
personal 86535
good 86605
fellowship 86793
even 86801
to 86806
the 86927
humblest 87188
private 87201
soldier 87219
If 87224
the 87241
cheer 87412
was 87428
repeated 87548
he 87593
would 87609
turn 87687
in 87715
his 87718
saddle 87792
and 87891
repeat 88014
the 88017
salute 88238
It 88246
was 88250
very 88255
plain 88258
that 88281
these 88285
little 88296
attentions 88304
to 88628
the 89015
troops 89055
took 89082
well 89086
and 89090
had 89116
no 89119
doubt 89292
some 89530
influence 90074
in 90165
establishing 90681
a 90689
sort 90927
of 91358
comradeship 91497
between 91869
him 91996
and 92507
them 92827
They 92848
were 92949
part 93419
of 93490
an 93554
attractive 93614
and 93670
winning 93688
deportment 93776
which 93857
adapted 93865
itself 93892
to 93907
all 94050
sorts 94080
and 94116
ranks 94153
of 94267
men 94360
On 94477
Tuesday 94490
he 94601
came 94694
a 94784
little 95105
later 95135
in 95419
the 95422
day 95431
and 95446
I 95735
noticed 95768
at 95819
once 96031
a 96037
change 96436
in 96450
his 96527
appearance 96938
He 97128
wore 97184
his 97228
yellow 97330
sash 97337
with 97423
sword 97961
and 98037
belt 98055
buckled 98065
over 98551
it 98555
and 98576
his 98579
face 98643
was 98649
animated 98724
as 98871
he 99020
greeted 99126
me 99194
with 99322
Well 99366
General 99377
I 99614
am 99679
in 99796
command 99820
again 99894
I 100161
congratulated 100619
him 100922
with 100980
hearty 101335
earnestness 101563
for 101572
I 101615
was 101728
personally 101733
rejoiced 101851
at 101867
it 101907
I 101922
was 101993
really 102048
attached 102106
to 102130
him 102402
believed 102419
him 102427
to 102910
be 102937
on 102941
the 103029
whole 103235
the 103306
most 103310
accomplished 103505
officer 103544
I 103574
knew 103582
and 103616
was 103663
warmly 103711
disposed 103851
to 103946
give 104190
him 104391
loyal 104415
friendship 104493
and 104513
service 104557
He 104564
told 104682
me 104753
of 105023
his 105399
cordial 105700
interview 105748
with 106178
President 106330
Lincoln 106348
and 106394
that 106479
the 106579
latter 106723
had 106774
said 106959
he 107022
believed 107032
him 107124
to 107129
be 107140
the 107222
only 107271
man 107325
who 107440
could 107444
bring 107594
organized 107623
shape 107642
out 107656
of 107941
the 107951
chaos 108176
in 108204
which 108659
everything 108820
seemed 108873
then 108893

be 108941
The 109342

of 109432
his 109472
new 109545
assignment 109590
to 109806
duty 109818
was 109865
that 110182
he 110218
was 110416
to 110477
have 110503
command 110597
of 110797
the 111363
fortifications 111508

in 121326

it 128836
for 128842
a 129052
new 129132
campaign 129243
McClellan 129321
seemed 129364
quite 129380
willing 129387
to 129470
postpone 129518
the 129545
question 129598
who 129629
would 129683
command 129751
when 129914
it 129920

the 130065

was 130465
in 130484
his 130496
own 130504
hands 130553
and 130571
the 130573
work 130589
of 130601
reorganization 130611
was 130622
that 130627
in 130652
which 130659
his 130689
prestige 130711
was 130718
almost 130820
sure 130850
to 130869
increase 130884
This 130941
attitude 131620
was 131791
plainly 131856
shown 131886
in 132029
all 132062
he 132147
said 132181
and 132189
in 132739
all 132900

Halleck 134661

bring 135421
the 135431

the 135808

had 135866
vainly 135899
tried 135914
to 135946

him 135993
to 136015
ride 136109
out 136154

accompanied 151127
him 151238

serious 157552
but 157848
alert 157851

self-possessed 158089
When 158110
we 158212
met 158456
after 158465
brief 158684
salutations 158734
McClellan 158768
announced 158867
that 158897

instantly 164441
turning 164455

King's 176051
division 176058
was 176128
such 176207
a 176224
reduction 176272
of 176501
his 176531
prominence 176710
as 176779
an 176797

that 176867
it 176941

McClellan 177647

a 177819

warmly 178001
greeted 178034

According 179497
to 179566
my 179661
recollection 179667
Colonel 179681
Colburn 179781
was 179815
the 179821
only 180510

had 181045
a 181113
small 181340
cavalry 181370

My 181407
understanding 181725
also 181805
was 181946
that 64816
they 88270
proposed 108758

toward 111113
those 111900

displeased 120248
him 127742

shrunk 104921

little 31195
from 56623
coming 23748
under 29959
his 47863
immediate 71349
orders 91889
through 92560
fear 110734
of 111276
some 144566
chafing 153543
though 193
I 4377
learned 4389
in 5320
the 10417
army 10605
that 13448
choleric 13694
commanders 15396
if 41724
they 45227
have 46088
ability 50252
are 50388
often 57236
warmly 58081
appreciative 60185
of 84093
those 84700
who 85499
serve 86108
them 86383
with 86525
soldierly 92127
spirit 94462

faithfulness 121018
No 121965
one 125467
who 126743
had 129425
any 130540
right 143404
to 143583
judge 143630
questioned 144956
Pope's 147046
ability 157028

his 178655
zeal 179712
in 179715

His 185450
military 5514
career 6921
in 7459
the 7835
West 10512
had 10951
been 12091
a 13319
brilliant 13729
one 13907
The 14826
necessity 19389
for 20794
uniting 24474
the 28467
columns 28589
in 29025
northern 31113
Virginia 31292
into 34245
one 34400
army 34904
was 35020
palpable 35635
but 36663
it 37694
was 40017
a 40236
delicate 40845
question 44348
to 45696
decide 46501
who 47156
should 50698
command 53100
them 53270
It 53364
seems 54801
to 56880
have 59109
been 61720
assumed 62982
by 63576
Mr 64634
Lincoln 66731
that 67574
the 67959
commander 68082
must 70819
be 71475
a 72418
new 75550
man 77909
--neither 79158
Fremont 81224
McDowell 81670
nor 85640
Banks 85850
The 87991
reasons 89903
were 90223
probably 90811
much 92497
the 92643
same 96782
as 98545
those 100268
which 101404
later 101561
brought 103841

Sheridan 105180

Pope's 114552
introduction 115911

army 123694
which 125823
I 126316
have 130050
already 132970
mentioned 135171
was 135277
an 135391
unfortunate 136350
one 139822
but 141853
neither 142642
he 143863
nor 144028
any 144136
one 150540
else 152195
could 154438
have 155312
imagined 155777
the 160014
heat 162022
of 162868
partisan 162966
spirit 163621
or 165988
the 166227
lengths 168904
it 169481
would 170337
run 173492
No 175169
personal 176364
vilification 177822
was 179013
too 180860
absurd 180938
to 182155
be 37546
credited 115328
and 115354
no 115395
characterization 135482
was 18744
too 41098
ridiculous 45777
to 69269
be 69376
received 69452
as 69760
true 138058
to 181347
the 181421
life 10549
It 182558
was 182832
assumed 184886
that 184946
he 185034
had 185201
pledged 185307
himself 185418
to 83850
take 104719
Richmond 180237
with 81979
an 25628
army 140126
of 122838
men 172549
when 2566
McClellan 73957
had 140482
failed 145788
to 6407
do 15016
so 38487
with 579
His 4169
defeat 4335
by 4366
Lee 7338
was 16903
taken 18072
to 18893
prove 20972
him 23259
contemptible 25388
as 26743
a 28617
commander 29551
by 44768
the 62131
very 64364
men 66752
who 66826
lauded 67996
McClellan 70934
for 77411
having 85458
escaped 93245
destruction 93259
from 95693
the 95940
same 96280
army 113738
There 114163
was 114212
neither 114227
intelligence 123188
nor 123510
consistency 136276
in 136310
the 136342
vituperation 142455
with 144069
which 144347
he 149175
was 149544
covered 164048
but 164218
there 164302
was 167003
abundant 168586
proof 169458
that 171719
the 171725
wounded 171741
amour 173939
propre 173958

practically 67049
a 67087
unit 75053
in 117009
intense 40177
dislike 62404
and 63160
distrust 81839
of 95251
him 169949
It 12163
may 16692
be 20607
that 38997
this 41551
condition 45943
of 71978
things 77792
destroyed 110992
his 166099
possibility 179327
of 26371
usefulness 39341
at 95947
the 20516

of 35169
human 79364
nature 159604
certainly 159611
too 107622

to 109147
me 109452
entirely 109767
right 110233
in 110667
claiming 110780
that 110866
Jackson's 111133

that 49689

His 72767

Maryland 102675
McClellan 102822

This 5721

that 31558

had 42749
before 49981
the 53168
President 55579

the 72421

advocated 171383

that 17493
would 17749
else 18149
be 18508
hopelessly 18986
broken 19438
down 19851
McClellan 20459
was 20858
then 21035
at 22174
Harrison's 23440
Landing 26786
believing 28380
Lee's 28810
army 31420
to 31956
be 39746
strong 56540
and 72110
refusing 72230
to 72385
listen 72580
to 73218
any 74153
suggestion 74402
except 74835
that 78760
enormous 79009
reinforcements 79290
should 79522
be 80300
sent 80621
to 80629
him 83152
there 83157
He 85024
had 85363
taught 85930
the 86028
Army 86152
of 86651
the 87026
Potomac 87345
to 88000
believe 88524
implicitly 88731
that 90087
the 93412
Confederate 93657
army 96446
was 97237
more 100311
than 107498
twice 108439
as 112591
numerous 118765
as 121383
it 127602
was 128720
in 129089
fact 131327
With 133388
this 133569
conviction 134296
it 134552
was 135387
natural 135552
that 135962
they 136077
should 136273
admire 136581
the 136889
generalship 137161
which 137348
had 137648
saved 137898
them 138318
from 138508
annihilation 138924
They 139566
accepted 141234
with 141288
equal 146159
faith 148241
the 152459
lessons 152583
which 154546
came 156412
to 157751
them 158529
from 158722
headquarters 159098
teaching 159390
that 159747
the 159876
radicals 160407
at 160563
Washington 161840
were 162086
trying 162112
for 162550
political 162962
ends 166455
to 168814
destroy 170223
their 170660
general 171035
and 171490
them 171612
In 171883
regard 172040
to 172200
the 172665
facts 172917
there 173184
were 173279
varying 173449
degrees 173563
of 173823
intelligence 174232
among 176859
officers 177842
and 177925
men 178730
but 6699
there 28463
was 59810
a 66985
common 67462
opinion 68137
that 68454
they 69178
and 69301
he 69661
were 70665
willingly 70888
sacrificed 71403
and 71586
that 71920
Pope 72170
the 72355
radical 73505
was 74405
to 74871
succeed 75409
him 75894
This 75916
made 75980
them 76112
hate 76340
Pope 76392
for 76775
the 76937
time 77087
with 77551
holy 77653
hatred 78046
If 78214
the 78354
army 79526
could 79709
at 80076
that 80624
time 80763
have 81220
compared 82214
authentic 82288
tables 83295
of 83917
strength 84271
of 85514
Lee's 85885
army 86037
and 86200
their 86573
own 126857
the 127150
whole 128151
theory 140855
would 172939
have 173629
collapsed 173911
at 174235
once 174303
and 174672
McClellan's 174971
reputation 175189
and 175297
popularity 175765
with 176333
it 176545
They 176823
did 177558
not 177816
have 179477
the 179598
authentic 180573
tables 7888

fought 86580

The 65183
fiction 13331
as 36929
to 82727
Lee's 175159
forces 1640
is 81011
the 85308
most 87659
remarkable 87704
in 126038
the 52896
history 91067
of 98845
modern 112543
wars 121783
Whether 73725
McClellan 54689
was 145590
the 144688
victim 64037
or 130
the 182579
accomplice 86682

secret 88223

we 141777
cannot 4431
tell 7456
It 83694
is 100817
almost 135103
incredible 142914

should 7896
be 18927
deceived 33057
except 66974
willingly 74433
I 83541
confess 92222
to 98552
a 102008
contempt 105697
for 109178
all 113195
organizations 115880

the 135966

We 142392
intercepted 152311

a 169480
letter 171158
from 175138
an 176294

had 11869

In 63052
counting 65683
my 66333
cannon 67582
she 71508
had 73546
evidently 76497
taken 99317
the 103058
teams 107290
as 114481
the 114549
easiest 117661
units 119272
to 123580
count 124690
and 129033
had 133356
set 133416
down 135667
every 148337
caisson 155913
as 156371
a 159086
gun 162540
with 163857
the 164070

accidental 52873
break 79347
in 183580
the 52339

She 46477
thus 53587

perfect 54494
good 66838
faith 67165
doubled 76084
my 85249
force 101776

taught 113887
me 116962
that 124001
such 124635
information 141498
to 148312
the 150053
enemy 151637
did 165598

good 46173

trustworthy 7608
is 39095

In 7397

I 7490
always 7576
carried 7599
a 7658

I 7745
noted 7760

corrected 7827
all 7875

information 8053
of 8082

sort 8199
which 8277
came 8328
to 8426
me 8477

by 8503

this 8560

others 8834

with 8931
the 8946
lists 9005
at 9148

was 9385
no 9477
difficulty 9492

keeping 9558
well 9610
up 9616
in 9656
the 9703
enemy's 9720
organization 9726
It 9745
may 9829
therefore 9837
be 9966
said 9972
that 9976
every 10049
commanding 10137
officer 10159
ought 10196
to 10202
know 10239
the 10261
divisions 10307
and 10311
brigades 10354
of 10372
his 10443
enemy 10568
The 10725
strength 10800
of 10838
a 10848
brigade 10931
is 10935
fairly 10968
estimated 11011
from 11081
the 11212
average 11266
of 11309
our 11355
own 11357
for 11362
in 11365
people 11379
of 11425
similar 11441
race 11478
and 11488
education 11501
the 11525
models 11530
of 11552
organization 11580
are 11589
essentially 11742
the 11771
same 11782
and 11833
subject 11838
to 11867
the 11872
same 11945
causes 11967
of 12110
diminution 12120
during 12133
a 12195
campaign 12217
Such 12243
considerations 12266
as 12281
these 12352
leave 12364
no 12375
escape 12379
from 12431
the 12459
conclusion 12462
that 12480
McClellan's 12488
estimates 12516
of 12547
Lee's 12561
army 12586
were 12595
absolutely 12648
destructive 12664
of 12699
all 12714
chances 12772
of 12907
success 12962
and 12971
made 12998
it 13001
impossible 13043
for 13054
the 13090
President 13106
or 13116
for 13158
General 13175
Halleck 13230
to 13268
deal 13353
with 13358
the 13368
military 13401
problem 13444
before 13485
them 13565
That 13718
he 13789
had 13969
continued 14013
this 14021
erroneous 14031
counting 14097
for 14126
more 14166
than 14214
a 14225
year 14385
and 14412
through 14423
an 14458
active 14492
campaign 14523
in 14561
the 14565

The 14963
reports 15084
of 15137
the 15172
peninsular 15406
campaign 15417
reveal 15450
at 15455
times 15492
the 15504
difficulty 15510
there 15524
was 15534
in 15751

The 16055
known 16076

an 31662

was 183461
warmly 129468
attracted 129997
by 130494
him 7932
as 57738
everybody 89030
was 99664
He 55555
was 167848
pre-eminently 49831
a 172277
manly 11057
man 87191
as 64040
I 184709
expressed 8716
it 152232
in 57586
writing 89552
home 150079
His 48937
large 85913
fine 162869
eyes 31054
his 182134
winning 143509
smile 183096
and 183112
cordial 183445
manners 183550
bespoke 4439
a 124619
frank 57535
sincere 47380
and 8995
honorable 22117
character 82481
and 149518
these 14882
indications 156379
were 57105
never 151230
belied 24318
by 35503
more 91211
intimate 682
acquaintance 83466
The 11353
friendship 46662
then 61238
begun 32487
lasted 52390
as 34052
long 146918
as 16147
he 147047
lived 116405
I 148104
learned 8419
to 52031
understand 57321
the 58598
limitations 59380
of 123567
his 27856
powers 108725
and 123534
the 14851
points 34349
in 38798
which 27718
he 13512
fell 13284
short 19270
of 19306
being 23350
a 26618
great 29502
commander 32198
but 32246
as 32384
I 35007
knew 37751
him 51157
better 62569
I 66283
estimated 66359
more 69230
and 69239
more 72554
highly 72570
his 72790
sincerity 78366
and 79276
truthfulness 80273
his 82870
unselfish 85420
generosity 85480
and 90213
his 91467
devoted 91555
patriotism 92063
In 92350
everything 92537
which 94811
makes 96056
up 96921
an 97983
honorable 100981
and 101415
lovable 101573
personal 102739
character 105406
he 114276
had 114715
no 116509
superior 135474
I 136660
shall 136699
have 138208
occasion 138899
to 138975
speak 156897
frequently 160171
of 160341
his 160379
peculiarities 160953
and 160960
his 161742
special 162159
traits 162350
but 163899
shall 164885
never 166155
have 166206
need 166221
to 167081
say 168041
a 172066
word 172843
in 173210
derogation 173747
of 174775
the 176208
solid 176230
virtues 176798
I 176868
have 177358

to 178869
him 178917
His 178932
chief-of-staff 180645
General 181454
Parke 61217
was 124599
an 181226

the 170872

of 35595
the 166334
best 4701
instructed 16346
of 35247
that 38732

and 120747
division 122050
I 122948
always 127911
thought 129708
that 145243
he 157331
preferred 2133
staff 118822
duty 53379
especially 51566
with 119427
Burnside 119886
whose 120493
confidence 120888
in 129783
him 137097
was 145024
complete 146093
and 146353
who 149488
would 151715
leave 2158
to 118847
him 27955
almost 59167
untrammelled 136006
control 137152

The 23231
Confederate 152379
army 155524
suffered 156877
from 70044
straggling 735
quite 3310
as 3930
much 4293
perhaps 4819
as 153824
ours 2794
but 152828
in 58772
a 128287
somewhat 160218
different 65046
way 126538
At 161134
the 13025
close 39170
of 61419
the 123659
Antietam 182878
campaign 184238
General 8034
Lee 13574
made 14005
bitter 20816
complaints 39090
in 57527
regard 70518
to 83784
it 84459
and 88317
asked 96809
the 122835
Confederate 125580
government 151599
for 153640
legislation 32061
which 45927
would 52326
authorize 52860
him 55050
to 57564
apply 57647
the 61210
severest 63752
punishments 64950
As 84764
the 110422
Confederate 138811
stragglers 142037
were 143011
generally 146033
in 155575
the 165587
midst 171391
of 177219
friends 42851
where 108754
they 117899
could 145028
sleep 118356
under 46880
shelter 57520
and 1648
get 81019
food 5366
of 11029
better 12358
quality 15962
than 18960
the 19469
army 20871
ration 27927
this 31395
grew 43826
to 49500
be 75799
the 94044
regular 97291
mode 102688
of 103230
life 123099
with 128978
many 149565
even 153267
of 153846
those 155330
who 165507
would 170740
join 171841
their 172777
comrades 36014
in 46195
an 86000
engagement 137449
They 141907
were 157709
not 176790
reported 3127
in 8623
the 50766
return 83820
of 152884
effectives 169633
made 175602
by 151551
their 142980
officers 34488
but 2144
that 2770
they 2776
often 118833
made 152804
part 152810
of 153671
the 154846
killed 155387
wounded 33389
and 44165
captured 45794
I 54741
have 148453
little 100293
doubt 150743
In 102178
this 170563
way 40515
a 136064
rational 173893
explanation 902
may 16262
be 34278
found 37879
of 56367
the 84757
larger 168612
discrepancies 178996
between 21380
the 27776
Confederate 39548
reports 41733
of 126191
casualties 145842
and 149027
ours 150555
of 179694
their 378
dead 695
buried 38332
and 46017
prisoners 63749
taken 77322
The 90934
weather 153044
during 154232
this 169500
brief 175264
campaign 38925
was 44310
as 98836
lovely 122606
as 147508
possible 182151
and 182291
the 41720
contrast 42632
between 42941
the 130537
rich 160318
farming 180863
country 16332
in 130122
which 141075
we 143617
now 156402

forest-covered 68098
mountains 89487

West 2804
Virginia 152838
to 43535
which 83376
we 51728
had 156591
been 9250
accustomed 10506
was 66518
very 125021
striking 125189
An 125331
evening 125442
march 125992
under 163194
a 17993
brilliant 142484
moon 22102

composed 177090
by 4288
a 80701
master 119790
artist 170715

in 72065
my 140690

page 178977
out 181032
of 23487
a 52482
lovely 73385

On 78060
the 81403
day 129441

we 159117
marched 71997
to 136708
Leesboro 33124
Lee's 104100

subject 6045
at 82143
our 83019

We 94665
moved 139759
forward 2358

very 5528
short 126169
marches 126239

eight 83407
miles 85570
feeling 89036
our 100654
way 128420
so 129867
cautiously 130150
that 165501
Lee's 166845
reports 170340
speak 4179
of 28014
it 38380
as 94032

McClellan's 2990

after 3102
the 3214
recent 4440
battle 4461
It 4959
must 6173
be 6402
remembered 6935
however 7040
that 7809
Sumner's 7867
corps 7912
and 8692
Franklin's 9075

not 9279
been 10111

were 15000
veterans 15102
of 15154
the 15252
Potomac 15331
Army 16707
The 16766
Twelfth 17129
Corps 17298
had 17739
been 17921
Banks's 17948
and 18761
it 19643
too 19656
had 19680
not 20193
been 20405

Although 34171

regiments 35059
had 35094
been 35844
added 35910
to 36132
these 36956
corps 37823
it 37839
is 39496
hardly 43205
proper 44352
to 45099
say 45178
that 45243
the 45650
army 46641
as 46926
a 47234
whole 48065
was 48370
not 48764
one 48910
which 50079
could 50096
be 52282
rapidly 52512
manoeuvred 53360
I 53483
see 54009
no 54711
good 55365
reason 56859
why 57856
it 58098
might 59293
not 60067
have 61146
advanced 61986
at 65942
once 67237

8th 133813
and 135000
marched 135046
to 135076
Brookville 135767
On 136050
the 137109
9th 137126
it 137335
reached 138449
Goshen 138678
where 140109
it 140736
lay 140832
on 141613
the 141903
10th 141973
and 143329
on 145818
the 146210
11th 147575
reached 147758
Ridgeville 149521
on 149790
the 150430
railroad 150907
The 151118
rest 151151
of 151823
the 151928
Ninth 152231
Corps 157665
was 158571
an 158984
easy 159232
march 160608
behind 162276
us 162852
Hooker 163348
had 163385
been 163396
ordered 163813
further 163824
to 164412
the 165567
right 165810
on 166025
the 166034
strength 166168
of 166719
rumors 167187
that 168324
Lee 169047
was 169325
making 169374
a 169608
circuit 169666
towards 170109
Baltimore 171162
and 171228
his 171603
corps 171711
reached 172764
Cooksville 172823
and 172892
the 173129
railroad 173431
some 173526
ten 174957
miles 174961
east 175387
of 175649
my 175949
position 176029
The 176970
extreme 179249
left 180749
of 180893
the 137228
army 148708
was 154684
at 87456
Poolesville 40101
near 18490
the 21310
Potomac 25390
making 29811
a 34736
spread 37429
of 37470
thirty 76000
miles 132814
across 165042
the 33909
whole 35753
front 35836
The 131773
cavalry 170032
did 40159
not 7862
succeed 28508
in 122420
getting 87487
far 119649
in 121344
advance 98610
of 121215
the 122473
infantry 100659
and 60932
very 61163
little 83671
valuable 158087
information 16790
was 113993
obtained 144983
At 147994
Ridgeville 42273
however 31473
we 77506
got 184632
reliable 90962
evidence 118201
that 18066
Lee 29378
had 67147
evacuated 88148
Frederick 99709
the 122923
day 137593
before 139126
and 139608
that 152516
only 157712
cavalry 157906
was 166820
east 176259
of 1786
the 99554
Catoctin 41752
Mountains 62468
Hooker 84578
got 150853
similar 169493
information 43527
at 84944
about 99773
the 55679
same 91453
time 36202
It 36116
was 66030
now 156439
determined 156634
to 165545
move 22467
more 176156
rapidly 179943
and 152956
early 88935
in 92936
the 13528
morning 48353
of 161458
the 6706
12th 7080
I 120234
was 120620
ordered 122527
to 127987
march 5029
to 47207
New 1748
Market 88637
and 90403
thence 94522
to 157246
Frederick 11770
At 74483
New 148937
Market 155377
I 170853
was 178538
overtaken 2519
by 140435
General 55080
Reno 90346
with 11543
several 23320
officers 69446
of 110819
rank 24848
from 35038
the 35563
other 37685
divisions 93286
of 107523
the 136667
corps 140847
and 141369
they 165310
dismounted 172011
at 50800
a 160550
little 29928
tavern 142083
by 95771
the 73871
roadside 38845
to 45905
see 45997
the 83921
Kanawha 117293
division 123274
go 129824
by 39015
Up 48311
to 54980
this 90682
time 172301
they 18
had 497
seen 1299
nothing 1382
of 1586
us 1688
whatever 4104
The 5066
men 5127
had 5325
been 6539
so 6639
long 7403
in 8920
the 10513
West 10626
Virginia 10630
mountains 10644
at 10962
hard 13463
service 13603
involving 15696
long 17284
and 17855
rapid 17899
marches 18302
that 18393
they 18770
had 19003
much 21244
the 22166
same 22233
strength 25203
of 26652
legs 26789
and 26867
ease 28356
in 28532
marching 28641
which 29211
was 31911
afterward 33139
so 33155
much 33962
talked 37769
of 37882
when 38281
seen 38970
in 39231
Sherman's 39238
army 39680
at 41369
the 41864
review 42234
in 42662
Washington 42816
at 43538
the 43561
close 43572
of 43611
the 44592
war 44951
I 47265
stood 47299
a 49362
little 49875
behind 50016
Reno 50024
and 51015
the 51530
rest 51627
and 51669
had 53614
the 53618
pleasure 53942
of 54065
hearing 54130
their 54198
involuntary 54234
exclamations 55092
of 55135
admiration 55140
at 55149
the 55155
marching 55176
of 55213
the 55292
men 55315
The 55571
easy 55602
swinging 55687
step 55839
the 55850
graceful 55904
poise 55944
of 55949
the 55954
musket 56083
on 56160
the 56248
shoulder 56678
as 56761
if 57368
it 57551
were 57574
a 57615
toy 57623
and 57767
not 58089
a 58187
burden 58352
and 58359
the 58485
compactness 59362
of 59397
the 59439
column 59725
were 59849
all 60400
noticed 60718
and 60900
praised 60950
with 61004
a 61401
heartiness 61416
which 61470
was 61718
very 61747
grateful 61755
to 61764
my 62355
ears 62373
I 62391
no 62672
longer 62828
felt 63265
any 63584
doubt 63654
that 63746
the 63756
division 63857
stood 64219
well 64467
in 64511
the 64609
opinion 64981
of 65075
my 65088
associates 65103
I 65107
enjoyed 65125
this 65163
the 65249
more 65264
because 65270
the 65306
evening 65341
before 66370
a 70326
little 71071
incident 71184
had 73755
occurred 74108
which 74142
had 74167
threatened 74177
to 74197
result 75849
in 76477
some 76481
ill-feeling 80957
It 81059
had 82754
been 83007
thought 84096
that 84558
we 84587
were 84610
likely 84877
to 84925
be 85084
attacked 85089
at 85186
Ridgeville 85354
and 85371
on 85902
reaching 85911
the 86386
village 86400
I 86406
disposed 86420
the 86760
division 87707
so 87748
as 87963
to 88009
cover 88027
the 88225
place 88405
and 88978
to 89970
be 90812
ready 90989
for 91044
an 91118
engagement 91123
I 91199
ordered 91326
the 91366
brigades 91410
to 91484
bivouac 92154
in 92484
line 92835
of 93111
battle 93131
covering 93479
the 94979
front 95012
with 96544
outposts 97224
and 97298
with 98520
cavalry 98540
vedettes 98771
from 98805
the 98843
Sixth 99069
New 99086
York 99218
Cavalry 99276
Colonel 99424
Devin 99886
which 101066
had 101074
been 101179
attached 101253
to 101885
the 102207
division 102387
during 102413
the 103221
advance 103313
The 103397
men 103421
were 103488
without 103681
tents 103690
and 103878
to 104009
make 106926
beds 107399
had 108113
helped 108747
themselves 108783
to 108954
some 110369
straw 110690
from 111046
stacks 112248
in 112292
the 112580
vicinity 112594
Toward 113430
evening 113441
General 113486
Reno 113553
rode 114548
up 114644
and 115958
happening 115988
first 116071
to 116139
meet 116150
Lieutenant-Colonel 116187
Rutherford 116541
B 117074
Hayes 117489
commanding 117898
the 118423
Twenty 118725
third 119270
Ohio 120185
he 121375
rather 121386
sharply 121415
inquired 121538
why 121587
the 121596
troops 121680
were 121697
not 121949
bivouacking 122040
closed 122080
in 122151
mass 122342
and 122399
also 122422
blamed 123027
the 123826
taking 123835
of 123842
the 123894
straw 124592
Colonel 124597
Hayes 124627
referred 124685
him 124800
to 125422
me 125431
as 125524
the 125541
proper 125755
person 125893
to 127222
account 128155
for 128234
the 128529
disposition 128561
of 129342
the 129670
troops 129883
and 129900
quietly 130083
said 130157
he 130371
thought 131119
the 132722
quartermaster's 132794
department 134497
could 135886
settle 135921
for 136846
the 136913
straw 141164
if 141496
the 141554
owner 141679
was 142067
loyal 143023
A 143084
few 143109
minutes 143213
later 143267
the 143699
general 143744
came 145026
to 145465
my 145485
own 145880
position 145890
but 146057
was 146170
now 146956
quite 147079
over 147283
his 147293
irritation 147498
I 148634
of 151360
course 151737
knew 152681
nothing 152695
of 152707
his 153426
interview 154958
with 154972
Hayes 155316
and 155320
when 155351
he 155440
said 156734
that 159330
it 159455
was 159594
the 160023
policy 160032
in 160146
Maryland 160395
to 161269
make 161298
the 161583
troops 162669
bivouac 162867
in 163260
compact 164687
mass 165497
so 165692
as 168738
to 168752
do 169507
as 170329
little 170475
damage 170493
to 170573
property 170662
as 170821
possible 170953
I 170992
cordially 171136
assented 171173
but 171191
urged 172556
that 172628
such 172697
a 172706
rule 173956
would 173984
not 175750
apply 177382
to 177876
the 178534
advance-guard 180016
when 180047
supposed 182422
to 182676
be 182711
in 182751
presence 182972
of 183114
the 183386
enemy 183388
we 183398
needed 183450
to 183464
have 183555
the 183897
men 184083
already 184510
in 184544
line 184759
if 184815
an 184905
alarm 184939
should 184943
be 184979
given 185000
in 185128
the 185323
night 185388
To 168150
this 80447
he 33833
agreed 75553
and 87016
a 128541
pleasant 5394
conversation 6252
followed 9163
Nothing 17316
was 17468
said 18648
to 20271
me 38443
about 62639
the 68422
straw 73348
taken 75590
for 75620
bedding 75879
and 75956
when 78464
I 81785
heard 84655
of 87065
the 87953
little 94254
passage-at-arms 97580
with 102936
Colonel 104274
Hayes 107487
I 112903
saw 121869
that 134745
it 146681
was 152338
a 152539
momentary 154592
disturbance 156819
which 158600
had 160553
no 167036
real 173191
significance 179272
Camp 143046
gossip 176036
however 37
is 39
as 43
bad 215
as 233
village 314
gossip 352
and 459
in 3466
a 3537
fine 3594
volume 3627
of 4507
the 4787
History 5054
of 5239
the 5290
Twenty-first 5297
Massachusetts 5317
Regiment 5404
I 5767
find 6525
it 6531
stated 6538
that 6638
the 6833
Kanawha 6963
division 7154
coming 7352
fresh 7367
from 7670
the 7746
West 7891
was 7954
disposed 8678
to 8919
plunder 8989
and 9052
pillage 9066
giving 9212
an 9245
exaggerated 9265
version 9269
of 9276
the 9284
foregoing 9315
story 9361
as 9372
evidence 9693
of 9714
it 9948
This 10228
makes 10232
it 10384
a 10414
duty 10606
to 10629
tell 10678
what 10869
was 10961
the 11182
small 11469
foundation 11585
for 11657
the 11684
charge 11707
and 12415
to 12442
say 12507
that 12569
I 12968
believe 13080
no 13164
regiments 13462
in 13529
the 13549
army 13585
were 13600
less 13669
obnoxious 13696
to 13813
any 13896
just 14079
accusation 14751
of 14964
such 15153
a 15236
sort 15760
The 15769
gossip 16277
would 16847
never 17052
have 17176
survived 17283
the 17341
war 17622
at 18406
all 18448
but 18525
for 18992
the 19323
fact 19458
that 19471
Colonel 19664
Hayes 19676
became 19766
President 20167
of 20655
the 20827
United 20918
States 21193
and 21241
the 21243
supposed 21250
incident 21327
of 21479
his 21570
army 22179
life 22187
thus 22446
acquired 22932
a 23262
new 23667
interest 23841
Footnote 23963
This 23981
incident 24257
gives 24449
me 24459
the 24550
opportunity 24662
to 24962
say 25072
that 25458
after 25576
reading 25594
a 25927
good 25990
many 26189
regimental 26418
histories 26425
I 26444
am 26479
struck 26535
with 26791
the 26866
fact 27215
that 27229
with 27371
the 27405
really 27497
invaluable 27537
material 27860
they 28115
contain 28240
when 28355
giving 28531
the 28579
actual 29181
experiences 29254
of 29361
the 29586
regiments 30251
themselves 30883
they 30996
also 31060
embody 31163
a 31205
great 31276
deal 31300
of 31533
mere 32216
gossip 32292
As 32315
a 32634
rule 32651
their 32930
value 33447
is 33572
confined 33675
to 33757
what 34107
strictly 34121
belongs 34137
to 34337
the 34383
regiment 34507
and 34854
the 35775
criticisms 35780
whether 36296
of 36348
other 36762
organizations 36833
or 37106
of 37311
commanders 37494
are 37577
likely 37919
to 38124
be 38250
the 38378
expression 39092
of 39111
the 39237
local 39581
and 39658
temporary 39930
prejudices 40233
and 40298
misconceptions 40372
which 40398
are 40431
notoriously 40490
current 40740
in 40939
time 41051
of 41081
war 41131
They 41199
need 41310
to 41408
be 41727
read 41771
with 41793
due 41907
allowance 42013
for 42135
this 42301
The 42421
volume 42444
referred 42930
to 43089
is 43122
a 43126
favorable 43685
example 43870
of 44345
its 44549
class 44630
but 44849
its 44859
references 44953
to 45008
the 45043
Kanawha 45113
division 45214
which 45230
was 45254
in 45352
the 45363
Ninth 45372
Corps 45428
only 45442
a 45797
month 45804
illustrate 45994
the 46084
tendency 46093
I 46184
have 46298
mentioned 46409
It 46474
should 46504
be 46535
borne 47129
in 47220
mind 47264
that 47298
the 47885
Kanawha 47965
men 49214
had 49485
the 49518
position 49915
of 49918
advance-guard 50015
and 50023
I 50028
believe 50050
did 50115
not 50272
camp 50280
in 50408
the 50857
neighborhood 51021
of 51037
the 51106
other 51626
divisions 51705
in 52026
a 52292
single 52306
instance 52354
from 52398
the 52664
time 52882
we 53107
left 53273
Leesboro 53337
till 53509
the 53563
battle 53581
of 54181
South 54314
Mountain 54375
What 54387
is 54430
said 54535
of 54895
them 54972
therefore 55070
is 55139
not 55173
from 55193
observation 55569
The 55570
incident 55703
between 55727
Reno 55760
and 55805
Hayes 55849
occurred 55884
in 56045
the 56067
camp 56143
of 56337
the 56403
latter 56921
and 56957
could 57004
not 57144
possibly 57187
be 57305
known 57417
to 57438
the 57557
author 57644
of 57912
the 57968
regimental 58067
history 58082
but 58088
by 58123
hearsay 58186
Yet 58243
he 58395
affirms 58544
as 58596
a 59031
fact 59086
that 59101
the 59399
Kanawha 59956
division 60082
plundered 60253
the 60382
country 60444
unmercifully 60593
for 60725
which 60812
Reno 60967
took 61003
Lieutenant-Colonel 61012
Hayes 61160
severely 61432
though 61445
justly 61763
to 61839
task 61926
He 62082
also 62233
asserts 62300
that 62927
the 62961
division 63117
set 63121
a 63195
very 63275
bad 63357
example 63518
in 63628
straggling 63680
As 63880
to 63995
this 64091
the 64314
truth 64493
is 64521
as 64565
I 64722
have 64730
circumstantially 64865
stated 65060
it 65073
above 65115
He 65171
has 65181
still 65285
further 65317
indulged 65479
in 65494
a 65584
slant 65600
at 66010
the 66320
Ohioans 66399
in 66506
a 66521
story 66765
of 66837
dead 67077
Confederates 67133
being 67164
put 67190
in 67327
a 67829
well 67871
at 68010
South 68077
Mountain 68124
--a 68288
story 68543
as 68623
apocryphal 68722
as 68835
the 69061
others 69181
Wise's 70161
house 70692
and 70755
well 70884
were 71529
within 71658
the 71669
camp 71676
of 73160
the 73701
division 73964
to 74270
which 74430
the 74641
Twenty-first 74785
Massachusetts 75067
belonged 75150
and 75493
the 75661
burial 75768
party 75780
there 75788
would 75828
have 75834
been 75861
from 75910
that 76029
division 76176
Lastly 76261
the 76422
writer 76931
says 77178
that 77300
General 77991
Cox 78323
the 78392
temporary 78395
corps 79904
commander 80008
robs 80144
us 80422
the 80683
Twenty-first 80702
Massachusetts 80924
of 81132
our 81484
dearly 81590
bought 81623
fame 81638
by 81672
naming 81757
the 82076
Fifty-first 82106
New 82237
York 82394
and 82411
Fifty-first 82461
Pennsylvania 82655
as 82885
the 82891
regiments 83218
which 83238
stormed 83250
the 83354
bridge 83478
at 83619
Antietam 83703
He 83843
acquits 83908
Burnside 84086
and 84095
McClellan 84163
of 84173
the 84217
alleged 84397
injustice 84404
saying 84530
they 84635
follow 84781
the 84924
corps 84963
report 85248
in 85290
this 85491
respect 85535
Yet 85787
mention 85943
is 86003
not 86119
made 86169
of 86385
the 86430
fact 86717
that 86721
my 86759
report 86920
literally 87249
copies 87277
that 87306
of 87360
the 87666
division 87790
commander 88026
who 88152
himself 88191
selected 88212
the 88471
regiments 88507
for 88510
the 88840
charge 88855
The 89007
Ohioan 89258
had 89325
soon 89465
gone 89528
west 89604
again 89873
with 89884
his 89931
division 89969
and 89995
was 90113
probably 90117
fair 90428
game 90698
There 90799
is 90833
something 90861
akin 90864
to 91205
provincialism 91582
in 91646
regimental 91728
esprit 91808
de 91884
corps 91987
and 92018
such 92042
instances 92113

the 92135
above 92177
which 92430
are 93168
all 93358

From 99603
New 99742
Market 99858
we 99885
sent 99930
the 100237
regiment 100494
of 100605
cavalry 100758
off 100784
to 100832
the 100995

our 101490
flank 101742
and 101897
to 101985
investigate 102218
reports 102576
that 102767
heavy 102843
bodies 103539
of 103621
the 103999
enemy's 104050
cavalry 104135
were 104449
north 104505
of 104519
us 104606
The 104715
infantry 104778
pushed 104936
rapidly 105031
toward 105344
Frederick 105994
The 106357
opposition 106464
was 106691
very 106866
slight 107361
till 107398
we 107461
reached 107784
the 107999
Monocacy 108268
River 108320
which 108338
is 108387
perhaps 108414
half 108451
a 108863
mile 109097
from 109675
the 110215

as 112156
rear-guard 112219
of 112500
Lee's 112648
army 112707
attempted 112725
to 113069
resist 113230
the 113323
crossing 113349
The 113358
highway 113381
crosses 113485

river 113573
by 113747
a 113886
substantial 113920
stone 114128
bridge 114264
and 114307
the 114317
ground 114336
upon 114344
our 114361
bank 114379
was 114405
considerably 114423
higher 114433
than 114436
that 114585
on 114643
the 114814
other 114957
side 115109
We 115339
engaged 115341
the 115408
artillery 115412
of 115505
the 115850
enemy 115957
with 115994
a 116077
battery 116152
of 116506
our 116517
own 116532
which 116780
had 116833
the 116959
advantage 117695
of 117897
position 117904
whilst 118095
the 118172
infantry 118208
forced 119108
the 119178
crossing 119344
both 119783
by 119791
the 119800
bridge 119813

of 120306
a 120323

to 120721
the 120875

as 121257
Moor's 121318
brigade 121330
was 121739
over 121870
it 122133
was 122270
deployed 122298
on 122310
the 122397
right 122405
and 122486
left 122678
of 122914
the 123145
turnpike 123151
which 123196
was 123206
bordered 123217
on 123332
either 123451
side 123542
by 123549
a 123583
high 123624
and 123706
strong 123708
post-and-rail 123804
fence 124076
Scammon's 124117
was 124188
soon 124273
over 124373
and 124545
similarly 124587
deployed 124591
as 124596
a 124603
second 124626

with 124900
the 125032
Eleventh 125192

Moor 125736
had 125818
with 125829
him 125839
a 126014
troop 126295
of 126461
horse 126755
and 126947
a 126981
single 127100
cannon 127203
and 127213
went 127218
forward 127262
with 127333
the 127626
first 127700
line 127791
allowing 127905
it 128034
to 128096
keep 128154
abreast 128233
of 128312
him 128321
on 128451
right 128730
and 128736
left 128784
I 128913
also 129420
rode 129465
on 129485
the 129496
turnpike 129654
between 129677
the 129681
two 129696
lines 129864
and 129948
only 130051
a 130075
few 130198
rods 130255
behind 130294
Moor 130370
having 130535
with 130911
me 130914
my 130921
staff 130937
and 131118
a 131235
few 131366

Reno 131646
was 131795
upon 132110
the 132141
other 132228
bank 132371
of 132426
the 132608
river 132721
overlooking 132793
the 132801
movement 132976
which 133094
made 133112
a 133497
fine 133692
military 133786
display 133897
as 134481
the 135072
lines 135244
advanced 135293
at 135912
quick-step 136039
toward 136205
the 136733
city 136836
Hampton's 136912
horsemen 137009
had 137061
passed 137224
out 137255
of 137548
our 137878
sight 138158
for 138176
the 138836
straight 139475
causeway 139514
turned 139771
sharply 139784
to 139793
the 139867
left 140022
just 140153
as 140169
it 140255
entered 140721
the 140752
town 141021
and 141163
we 141553
could 141661
not 141725
see 141755
beyond 142043
the 142047
turn 142051
We 142096
were 142103
perhaps 142822
a 142870
quarter 143083
of 143313
a 143492
mile 143825
from 144363
the 144378
city 144478
when 144609
a 144690
young 144886
staff 144926
officer 144946
from 145025
corps 145189
headquarters 145222
rode 145234
up 145305
beside 145362
me 145464
and 145686
exclaimed 145736
in 145742
a 145807
boisterous 145907
way 145952
Why 146068
don't 146169
they 146173
go 146191
in 146205
faster 146317
There's 146433
nothing 147238
there 147294
I 147365
said 147424
to 147429
the 147435
young 147481
man 147488
Did 147510
General 147521
Reno 148003
send 148058
you 148077
with 148178
any 148188
order 148311
to 149254
me 149272
No 149346
he 149439
replied 149473
Then 149493
said 150106
I 150163
when 150384
I 150563
want 150750
your 150763
advice 150775
I 150958
will 151226
ask 151428
it 151475
He 151630
moved 151693
off 152318
abashed 152724
and 153001
I 153083
did 153236
not 153436
notice 154249
what 154267
had 154338
become 154643
of 154653
him 154721
but 154870
in 154874
fact 154907
he 155030
rode 155219

Colonel 155350
Moor 155484
and 155664
repeated 155924
a 156092
similar 156106
speech 156190
Moor 156464
was 156484
stung 156666
by 156727
the 157264
impertinence 157655
which 158239
he 158376
assumed 158503
to 158592
be 158853
a 158953
criticism 159123
upon 159272
him 159444
from 159513
corps 159755
headquarters 159997
and 160280
to 160820
my 160852
amazement 161158
I 161165
saw 161207
him 161211
suddenly 161297
dash 161573
ahead 161956
at 162128
a 162216
gallop 162268
with 162560
his 162668
escort 162720
and 162749
the 162831
gun 162843
He 162924
soon 163157
came 163259
to 163555
the 163596
turn 163662
of 163672
the 163785
road 163794
where 163860
it 163872
loses 164082
itself 164357
among 164520
the 164541
houses 164632
there 165521
was 165628
a 165740
quick 165792
sharp 165852
rattling 165987
of 165990
carbines 166066
and 166752
Hampton's 166866
cavalry 167486
was 167644
atop 167850
of 168011
the 168158
little 168727
party 168977
There 168989
was 169654
one 169752
discharge 169920
of 169929
the 169974
cannon 170022
and 170162
some 170203
of 170328
the 170370
brigade 170433
staff 170572
and 170640
escort 170648
came 170870
back 170961
in 170997
disorder 171024
I 171108
ordered 171190
up 171399
at 171406
double 171442
quick 171449
the 171527
Eleventh 171561
Ohio 171729
which 172284
as 172332
I 172363
have 172444
said 172494
was 172658
in 173252
column 173264
in 173387
the 174238
road 174646
and 174836
these 174859
with 174986
bayonets 175441
fixed 175554
dashed 175772
into 175777
the 175783
town 176319
The 176348
enemy 176396
had 176510
not 176611
waited 177008
for 177096
them 177129
but 177212
retreated 177250
out 177268
of 177279
the 177317
place 177403
by 177480
the 177494
Hagerstown 177501
road 177575
Moor 177613
had 177735
been 177905
ridden 178016
down 178350
unhorsed 178441
and 178960
captured 179553
The 179560
artillery-men 179614
had 179732
unlimbered 179752
the 179888
gun 179944
pointed 180140
it 180172
and 180180
the 180694
gunner 180718
stood 180901
with 180935
the 180959
lanyard 181330
in 181380
his 181758
hand 181884
when 181889
he 181923
was 182020
struck 182189
by 182262
a 182268
charging 182272
horse 182306
the 182391
gun 182406
was 182415
fired 182631
by 183234
the 183417
concussion 183419
but 183423
at 183463
the 184405
same 184419
moment 184485
it 185153
was 122364
capsized 2157
into 118846
the 2768
ditch 152802
by 1617
the 80988
impact 76798
of 2205
the 2732
cavalry 3698
column 4893
The 5706
enemy 6403
had 6762
no 7883
time 8554
to 9054
right 9774
the 10167
gun 10561
or 10680
carry 10712
it 10852
off 10856
nor 10988
to 11391
stop 12865
for 15060
prisoners 15076
They 16203
forced 17616
Moor 17830
on 18087
another 18521
horse 18541
and 18888
turned 21258
tail 22588
as 22598
the 23540
charging 24650
lines 24985
of 25403
infantry 26012
came 29245
up 30158
on 30408
right 30864
and 30867
left 31062

It 54017

happened 56099
and 57311

that 113326
I 113400

The 116918

was 124630
a 124672
peculiarly 124675
brilliant 124803
idea 125620
but 125945
he 128900
has 129637
evidently 132221
confused 132403

He 140734
says 146285
Toward 148014
evening 148695
the 149747
enemy 150783
arrived 152154
in 152766
the 153186
immediate 153363
neighborhood 153680
of 154469
Monocacy 154937

observing 158579
only 160434

small 162407
force 162899
at 164087
this 164514
point 165208
advanced 165711
very 165967
carelessly 166893
A 169496
six-pounder 169509
gun 170132
had 170365
been 171370
placed 171451
in 171534
position 171548
by 171767
them 173575
at 175392
a 179413
very 180317
short 180466
distance 180475
from 181079
the 181877
bridge 182401
which 183225
fired 183792
from 184988
time 185080
to 692
time 4283
a 5636
shot 8017
at 8336
our 10803
horsemen 11645
while 16576
the 35720
foremost 36370

marched 40449
along 42249
at 44857
their 53967
ease 55058
as 59229
if 60092
they 61952
believed 65102
this 67775
small 73501
body 78070
of 78695
cavalry 82037
would 88170
soon 91886
wheel 98323

flight 113942
This 114040
favorable 123402
moment 147050
for 151327
an 161948
attack 171830
was 180995
seized 182330
in 182424
splendid 1259
style 50489
by 59651
Major 64351

as 55212
our 55457
rear-guard 14528
Like 130680
lightning 144779
he 57972
darted 1082
across 2253
the 2352
bridge 4677
taking 24997
the 26022
piece 33230
of 36869
artillery 37036
which 38155
had 39843
scarcely 39886
an 49937
opportunity 50733
of 68848
firing 69734
a 71548
shot 72399

falling 76024
upon 76139
the 77835

could 131875
not 132368

over 3197

Jackson's 55126

the 91139

Three 104669

been 111419
lost 112077
in 112444
the 114840

The 152800

was 140422

after 30750
P 57794
M 123840
at 123859

he 143264
sent 143282
a 152903

to 163943
Washington 169131

The 58703
failure 58705
to 124566
be 140960
equal 141457
to 143153
the 149300

was 30499
not 39670
in 46115
his 58807

Twenty-four 88150
hours 110389
as 124556
it 148070
turned 177393
out 6763
was 9422
the 12992
whole 16395
difference 17081
between 23020
saving 23222
and 23685
losing 24451
Harper's 25978

with 35843
its 41768
ten 49970

its 82713
unestimated 92765
munitions 95056
and 99378
stores 102481
It 107967
may 109179
be 116226
that 117173
the 132905
commanders 135945
of 139714
the 141301
garrison 154376
were 150829
in 4728
fault 106104
and 13581
that 45734
a 49784
more 49913
stubborn 50271
resistance 50279
should 57852
have 62247
been 63372
made 64759
It 64892
may 65399
be 72193
that 78176
Halleck 83035
ought 84752
to 98837
have 120771
ordered 134926
the 135338
place 148826
to 150440
be 184860
evacuated 325
earlier 3772
as 4936
McClellan 9764
suggested 10366
Nevertheless 13222
at 14570
noon 16948
of 20116
the 20255
13th 20694
McClellan 20798
had 20948
it 22280
in 24580
his 27069
power 27851
to 32573
save 36645
the 36706
place 37696
and 38575
interpose 38870
his 41134
army 44188
between 47562
the 49462
two 54755
wings 58367
of 61060
the 62324
Confederates 65387
with 70249
decisive 72858
effect 73073
on 78218
the 78360
campaign 78453
He 78649
saw 83550
that 85534
it 89049
was 89303
an 96315
emergency 98885
but 99005
did 101954
not 113325
call 126081
upon 128948
his 131396
men 135591
for 136875
any 144955
extraordinary 162748
exertion 167646
Harper's 167967
Ferry 173453
surrendered 173723
and 179356
Lee 30717
united 62353
the 64676
wings 64727
of 71370
his 89324
army 92126
beyond 94041
the 142727
Antietam 148033
before 160321
the 4884
final 5714
and 18872
general 27352
engagement 27809
was 29485
forced 41688
upon 44036
him 44362
At 44633
my 45707
camp 48564
in 53294
front 55567
of 64895
Middletown 66951
I 68434
received 73698
no 81534
orders 87672
looking 87706
to 90029
a 102624
general 102969
advance 105761
on 121236
the 123186
14th 124784
but 127565
only 134904
to 135231
support 136715
by 136751
a 142063
detachment 157396
Pleasonton's 160807
cavalry 175725
in 176257
a 7515
reconnoissance 8588
toward 8738
Turner's 8830
Gap 23615
Pleasonton 25931
himself 31399
came 53580
to 55983
my 60326
tent 65858
in 68176
the 69666
evening 70895
and 75997
asked 83472
that 85226
one 86556
brigade 87723
might 89198
report 102073
to 104372
him 112186
in 116749
the 117123
morning 118086
for 118982
the 126837
purpose 133656
Six 134171
o'clock 135264
was 136122
the 140296
hour 153204
at 158966
which 172223
he 175850
wished 10479
them 99649
to 103433
march 129421
He 6394
said 8006
further 14923
that 19017
he 20178
and 26068
Colonel 26124
Crook 26386
were 27083
old 30863
army 34999
acquaintances 36908
and 37000
that 46889
he 51943
would 66083
like 72432
Crook 86641
to 93158
have 99253
the 100156
detail 100421
I 106664
wished 132853
to 136661
please 144245
him 157941
and 177454
not 179851
thinking 44524
that 5354
it 5532
would 5647
make 5670
any 25792
difference 25887
to 34280
my 34603
brigade 35092
commanders 35154
intimated 35572
that 43304
I 44349
would 45836
do 48878
so 52117
But 52521
Colonel 52589
Scammon 65348
learning 65975
what 68539
was 70393
intended 80182
protested 81267
that 88858
under 95788
our 100474
custom 102459
his 104158
brigade 107147
was 107192
entitled 107767
to 109348
the 110073
advance 110117
next 110165
day 114019
as 114206
the 119753
brigades 120801
had 123559
taken 126930
it 127125
in 131380
turn 138869
I 142661
explained 144771
that 149724
it 156301
was 160162
only 160258
as 168389
a 29237
courtesy 30256
to 106408
Pleasonton 106606
and 107037
at 1848
his 104801
request 105520
that 105568
the 107774
change 108209
was 109565
proposed 5075
This 7472
did 8916
not 11793
better 15661
the 16591
matter 19280
in 19782
Scammon's 19824
opinion 20019
He 21949
had 22081
been 22804
himself 24777
a 26209
regular 26821
officer 27220
and 28150
the 28560
point 29411
of 30290
professional 31083
honor 32227
touched 32466
him 35206
I 35334
recognized 37277
the 37332
justice 37413
of 37559
his 38400
demand 38857
and 42409
said 42872
he 43320
should 44054
have 47346
the 47573
duty 50695
if 50907
he 51087
insisted 51846
upon 52929
it 53054
Pleasonton 54973
was 55630
still 58529
in 60783
the 69463
camp 71513
visiting 72208
with 72759
Colonel 73064
Crook 74856
and 76718
I 76988
explained 77603
to 79101
him 79135
the 80282
reasons 80780
why 81707
I 82907
could 83173
not 85074
yield 88555
to 88584
his 90004
wish 90101
but 90181
must 91109
assign 91589
Scammon's 91655
brigade 91725
to 92069
the 92768
duty 93075
in 93371
conformity 94818
with 95061
the 95136
usual 95457
course 95551
There 95625
was 96091
in 96134
fact 97200
no 97242
reason 97331
except 97496
the 97740
personal 97880
one 98056
for 98092
choosing 98135
one 98202
brigade 100488
more 100586
than 100743
the 100790
other 101016
for 101595
they 102289
were 102454
equally 102665
good 102878
Crook 102967
took 103074
the 103299
decision 103311
in 103732
good 103906
part 104181
though 105639
it 105900
was 106010
natural 106103
that 106179
he 106334
should 106380
wish 106480
for 106669
an 106700
opportunity 106859
of 107150
distinguished 107310
service 107326
as 107820
he 107952
had 108006
not 108035
been 108291
the 108694
regular 108723
commandant 109140
of 109170
the 109378
brigade 109440
Pleasonton 109459
was 109469
a 109591
little 110332
chafed 110386
and 110476
even 110638
intimated 111318
that 112090
he 112733
claimed 113825
some 113856
right 115246
to 115269
name 116245
the 116272
officer 116606
and 116628
command 116670
to 116810
be 116890
detailed 116932
This 116955
of 116981
course 117018
I 117041
could 117056
not 117597
admit 117714
and 117789
issued 117870
the 117951
formal 118069
orders 118261
at 119529
once 120540
The 121196
little 121297
controversy 122978
had 126005
put 126158
Scammon 127573
and 128816
his 129847
whole 131365
brigade 131400
upon 131986
their 132219
mettle 132342
and 132521
was 133032
a 133329
case 134829
in 134947
which 136021
a 136921
generous 138134
emulation 139360
did 142068
no 144623
harm 146326
What 148394
happened 151342
in 154451
the 156623
morning 162784
only 163020
increased 163496
their 164141
spirit 164830
and 165213
prepared 165263
them 165516
the 166396
better 167738
to 171008
perform 171125
what 171168
I 171299
have 171731
always 173057
regarded 173241
as 173505
a 173737

of 181231
Sunday 2070
the 111433
14th 127073
of 2517
September 3673
was 140433
a 143495
bright 148163
one 155717
I 184319
had 184703
my 142554
breakfast 153374
very 155700
early 183940
and 92698
was 32551
in 41076
the 53979
saddle 4089
before 5571
it 89611
was 12294
time 143324
for 143920
Scammon 6484
to 7274
move 36960
He 57789
was 119041
prompt 5466
and 29872
I 56185
rode 140905
on 10432
with 90359
him 20240
to 21317
see 62415
in 63402
what 64169
way 79240
his 101912
support 142466
was 177027
likely 43494

the 142397

and 169497
one 173993

in 27837
front 30150
of 31568
the 35530
cavalry 43032
camp 50861
about 52677
half 53675
a 57150
mile 58141
beyond 61646
the 62412
forks 70576
of 73141
the 74261
old 75350
Sharpsburg 76313
road 90889
with 92110
the 93709
turnpike 96565
They 96642
were 98383
exchanging 102698
shots 102824
with 108425
a 109549
battery 113866
of 114961
the 115502
enemy 119793
well 120487
up 121104
in 124391
the 124713
gap 127046
Just 135424
as 142090
Scammon 147572
and 148717
I 155574
crossed 155903
Catoctin 157328
Creek 160382
I 162846
was 165195
surprised 168624
to 172074
see 173039
Colonel 174770
Moor 177255
standing 178199
at 137088
the 10365
roadside 24934
With 34380
astonishment 64729
I 64761
rode 64833
to 79324
him 136485
and 146820
asked 158397
how 50975
he 57882
came 84425
there 124696
He 40091
said 7649
that 46340
he 55790
had 58802
been 60381
taken 70312
beyond 87133
the 88042
mountain 101962
after 109813
his 153016
capture 161430
but 166713
had 2212
been 2271
paroled 21971
the 22108
evening 22163
before 22208
and 22222
was 22338
now 22881
finding 31085
his 39191
way 53067
back 53176
to 53298
us 54524
on 54592
foot 56246
But 56313
where 66535
are 81781
you 84249
going 84761
said 85917
he 98987
I 118901
answered 119772
that 120086
Scammon 125308
was 125528
going 125555
to 125606
support 126125
Pleasonton 126389
in 126401
a 127028
reconnoissance 127278
into 128270
the 130163
gap 141248
Moor 144542
made 147204
an 150952
involuntary 152588
start 154606
saying 154710
My 157110
God 157368
be 157932
careful 178583
then 181726
checking 182097
himself 182473
added 184942
But 2140
I 118829
am 2147
paroled 118836
and 131387
turned 2243
away 21546
I 27987
galloped 28158
to 28317
Scammon 34815
and 35675
told 56406
him 81501
that 84993
I 88240
should 89421
follow 91422
him 122069
in 123446
close 126097
support 126262
with 126289
Crook's 127367
brigade 129922
and 130378
as 151145
I 151808
went 170333
back 170480
along 170519
the 7068
column 12066
I 67972
spoke 105154
to 107868
each 36174
regimental 81904
commander 123193
warning 12717
them 147130
to 146885
be 19982
prepared 22441
for 22856
anything 24722
big 24967
or 25301
little 26484
--it 28808
might 31411
be 33330
a 33538
skirmish 33824
it 34037
might 34310
be 34942
a 35163
battle 35369
Hurrying 35552
to 36694
camp 37538
I 40762
ordered 40874
Crook 41352
to 56538
turn 76778
out 76808
his 77090
brigade 80293
and 80357
march 80632
at 83160
once 87974
I 88734
then 92855
wrote 112313
a 149435
dispatch 184310
to 184698
General 5321
Reno 149633
saying 152423
I 28452
suspected 121980
we 61498
should 155830
find 178532
the 68066
enemy 120859
in 150114
force 153247
on 163300
the 169400
mountain 170043
top 153271
and 153325
should 54961
go 56382
forward 75710
with 101904
both 155302
brigades 155599
instead 180244
of 182469
sending 60156
one 61616
Starting 185333
a 182656
courier 182756
with 182835
this 182876
I 185090
rode 42566
forward 115784
again 169197
and 181918
found 18301
Pleasonton 99974
Scammon 184470
had 184502
given 9502
him 40317
an 40745
inkling 42900
of 61070
our 61703
suspicions 132718
and 142343
in 146901
the 146924
personal 150886
interview 32171
they 34168
had 34430
reached 146933
a 146448
mutual 146581
good 2580
understanding 140496
I 58967
found 57470
that 58883
he 60042
was 86795
convinced 280
that 1311
it 4463
would 5087
be 5135
unwise 5378
to 5991
make 9203
an 10826
attack 11604
in 12001
front 12574
and 14791
had 21457
determined 23906
that 27832
his 30817
horsemen 35218
should 47370
merely 53460
demonstrate 56690
upon 57078
the 58007
main 58851
road 59120
and 59313
support 59601
the 59640
batteries 59841
whilst 60794
Scammon 61265
should 61639
march 62190
by 62418
the 64155
old 64206
Sharpsburg 64596
road 65017
and 65450
try 81698
to 83728
reach 89656
the 90929
flank 126509
of 139810
the 139988
force 140083
on 145276
the 145725
summit 169152
I 184802
told 27754
him 86711
that 3641
in 20774
view 64742
of 47018
my 82808
fear 140986
that 44803
the 49182
force 330
of 4615
the 4645
enemy 10563
might 25135
be 25352
too 30976
great 33465
for 42289
Scammon 44411
I 62590
had 70121
determined 70143
to 103807
bring 105034
forward 112199
Crook's 115327
brigade 119787
in 119803
support 121321
If 130489
it 133044
became 135078
necessary 137946
to 138154
fight 170718
with 170810
the 172552
whole 180864
division 76942
I 22152
should 137959
do 173614
so 45566
and 17654
in 44381
that 62696
case 67487
I 29262
should 136252
assume 8073
the 129043
responsibility 92324
myself 8066
as 56306
his 135064
senior 4991
officer 5124
To 6059
this 6854
he 8090
cordially 8142
assented 9449
One 11236
section 11278
of 12926
McMullin's 13928
six-gun 15508
battery 23736
was 24229
all 24627
that 25943
went 27741
forward 30005
with 34465
Scammon 51532
and 51699
even 52205
these 57960
not 58055
till 58519
the 62869
infantry 63665
reached 64902
the 65185
summit 65232
four 70042
guns 77504
being 80458
left 80928
behind 87515
as 87520
the 91397
road 93283
was 94008
rough 96009
and 96969
steep 96998
There 106913
were 108085
in 119705
Simmonds's 119719
battery 124106
two 126192
twenty-pounder 126443
Parrott 133979
guns 141579
and 146508
I 149278
ordered 150704
these 153332
also 161603
to 161942
remain 164226
on 172168
the 179194
turnpike 179913
and 6775
to 10718
go 12042
into 13537
action 14179
with 28233
Benjamin's 31355
battery 43574
of 52901
the 58505
same 59866
calibre 73387
It 79892
was 81760
about 90503
half-past 91009
seven 94363
when 100070
Crook's 102616
head 128118
of 129568
column 152533
filed 158303
off 159719
from 166691
the 167150
turnpike 179541
upon 180186
the 180756
old 130804
Sharpsburg 164640
road 95323
and 10532
Scammon 41698
had 30911
perhaps 53634
half 79188
an 95086
hour's 122945
start 143496
We 143748
had 143751
fully 143855
two 144115
miles 144165
to 156182
go 177320
before 75907
we 143887
should 148164
reach 154889
the 157378
place 184587
where 184597
our 184624
attack 60438
was 89053
actually 155217
made 1359
and 56738
as 1421
it 28739
was 52469
a 59083
pretty 60610
sharp 62213
ascent 62996
the 64195
men 65727
marched 66092
slowly 66242
with 70637
frequent 72509
rests 112675
On 125088
our 135470
way 154996
up 164551
we 167156
were 184225
overtaken 184531
by 67202
my 68109
courier 122496
who 153131
had 154978
returned 155596
from 158255
General 179319
Reno 2084
with 2223
approval 2737
of 7047
my 7600
action 10094
and 10173
the 11359
assurance 11372
that 12549
the 13962
rest 16469
of 16826
the 17862
Ninth 17937
Corps 19605
would 19627
come 20880
forward 23007
to 26769
my 29298
support 29567
When 29692
Scammon 29799
had 30660
got 32250
within 32607
half 32732
a 34403
mile 35877

Fox's 37224
Gap 37281

called 42560
the 42766
Braddock 46527
road 46999

by 51971

I 71719
have 72341
adopted 72995
that 73438

seems 78873
to 78994
be 79942
in 81365
most 83045
common 86018
local 86770
use 90538
the 90755
enemy 91616
opened 91644
upon 95110
him 95246
with 95380
case-shot 95447
from 95524
the 95555

of 95718
the 96109

above 96528
the 96616

he 97448
had 97487
judiciously 97519
turned 97791
off 97819
upon 98130
a 98194
country 98358
road 98699
leading 99672
still 99689
further 100328
to 100517

nearly 102277

to 102870
the 103354

made 106003
under 106096
cover 106312
of 106599
the 106846

he 107604
had 107672
reached 107715
the 107889
extreme 107955
southern 108245

Here 115437
I 115466
overtook 115778
him 115812
his 116179

being 116706
formed 116820
in 116984

had 146954

to 148393

in 152771
the 154145

possible 164449
the 164564

bloody 47982
battle 48254

it 49242
was 49891
almost 50651
noon 51355
The 52087
troops 52224
began 52236
to 52346
feel 52499
the 52663
exhaustion 53558
of 54266
such 54520
labor 54528
and 54839
struggle 55037
We 55733
had 56215
several 56269
hundred 56994
prisoners 57155
in 57659
our 57753
hands 58047
and 58294
the 58327
field 58759
was 59609
thickly 59661
strewn 61603
with 61916
dead 62057
in 63046
gray 63310

the 67437

encumbered 68762
with 69166
hundreds 70370
of 70519

We 71668
learned 72662
from 73008
our 73174
prisoners 73474
that 73626

Longstreet's 81849

was 83217
in 83814
close 83923

I 85247
was 85384
momentarily 85545
expecting 85752
to 85912
hear 86168
from 86720
the 87205
supporting 87604
divisions 89598
of 89679
the 89687
Ninth 91328
Corps 91695
and 92657
thought 92885
it 93828
the 94520
part 94904
of 95073
wisdom 95770
to 96398
hold 96960
fast 96995

The 104499
two 104649
Kanawha 104690
brigades 106188
had 106492
certainly 106677
won 107025
a 107245
glorious 107439
victory 107529
and 107933
had 108029
made 109321
so 109594
assured 109878
a 110040
success 110674
of 111123
the 111223
day's 111659
work 111747
that 111887

falling 13737

notice 36020
these 36460

Willcox's 53755

to 54792
me 54819
about 54869
two 54900

and 55180
would 55274
have 55325
been 55338
up 55359
earlier 55531

for 55710
a 55742

in 56888
the 56890
delivery 57991
of 58108
a 61211
message 61362
to 61489
him 61500
He 62752
had 62965
sent 64951

Middletown 66930
to 69402
ask 69961
me 69977
where 70057
I 70116
desired 70301
him 70392
to 70530
come 75049
and 77755
finding 81652
that 82160
the 83450

had 83646
no 84645
clear 86414
idea 89003
of 89415
the 89493
roads 91783
by 96936
which 114390
he 120279
had 120537
travelled 121046
I 126582
directed 130861
him 134443
to 135793
say 137143
that 139715
General 139981
Pleasonton 141562
would 141597
point 143014
out 149159

Willcox 56379
understood 139923
the 86332
messenger 141500
that 34129
I 36193
wished 42346
him 55360
to 135004
inquire 160024
of 9772
Pleasonton 26717
where 48011
he 77248
had 127123
better 141100
put 53776
his 48480
division 127934
in 129712
and 87292
on 75567
doing 120182
so 14003
the 89002
latter 23345
suggested 47976
that 69380
he 9295
move 11839

Burnside 135988

recalling 57288
him 73539

could 8342
have 1080
been 1518
intended 1720
to 2405

the 11279
men 11956
of 12680
the 12726
Kanawha 13984
division 14915
took 14938
up 15441
the 21889
attack 21973
and 22165
completed 22250
their 22366
rout 22512
Willcox 22565
succeeded 22905
in 23150
getting 24805
a 25632
foothold 25888
on 26917
the 26944
further 27093
side 27108
of 27111
the 27151
open 27212
ground 27245

driving 27342
off 27363
the 27554
artillery 27666
which 27803
was 27823
there 27934
Along 28682
our 28740
centre 28866
and 30640
left 30683
where 30721
the 31817
forest 32568
was 32663
thick 32854
the 32882
enemy 33204
was 33245
equally 34455
repulsed 34727
but 34839
the 34858
cover 34888
of 34957
the 36178
timber 36181
enabled 36191
them 36317
to 36870
keep 38058
a 38156
footing 38246
near 38356
by 38529
whilst 38880
they 38944
continually 39096
tried 39722
to 39764
extend 40280
so 40792
as 40831
to 40844
outflank 40906
us 40938
moving 41462
their 42621
troops 42874
along 43001
a 44846
road 44887
which 45035
goes 45961
diagonally 46037
down 46210
that 46731
side 46813

the 49041
mountain 50675

on 52511
the 52522
north 52924
of 54105
the 54193
National 55020
road 55791
had 55866
been 55879
annoying 56239
to 56273
Willcox's 56416
men 60597
as 62303
they 62525
advanced 63278
but 63441
Sturgis 64850
sent 64857
forward 65349
Durell's 68285
battery 68478
from 69400
his 71575
division 71595
as 71608
soon 72797
as 72945
he 73671
came 74042
up 74851
and 75611
this 76086
gave 76121
special 76515
attention 78123
to 78490
these 78497
hostile 78555
guns 78637
diverting 79675
their 79766
fire 79926
from 80024
the 80069
infantry 80079
Hooker's 80085
men 80092
of 80319
the 80329
First 81086
Corps 81089
were 81155
also 81164
by 81327
this 81341
time 81381
pushing 81547
up 81716
the 82085
mountain 82139
on 82908
that 83179
side 83204
of 83301
the 83970
turnpike 84742
and 84850
we 85135
were 85546
not 86115
again 87132
troubled 87744
by 87766
artillery 90634
on 90778
our 90939
right 91675
flank 91762
It 91793
was 92619
nearly 92690
five 92798
o'clock 92808
when 92832
the 92933
enemy 97039
had 97068
disappeared 98188
in 98290
the 98338
woods 99135
beyond 100660
Fox's 100682
Gap 102015
and 102113
Willcox 112080
could 113244
reform 113363
his 113391
shattered 115195
lines 119047
As 119146
the 119215
easiest 119269
mode 119339
of 119348
getting 119379
Sturgis's 119498
fresh 119531
men 120148
into 120287
position 120362
Willcox 120425
made 120454
room 120463
on 120541
his 120562

for 122304
Ferrero's 122365

supported 123030
by 125872
Nagle's 125887

the 133577
last 133663
of 133711
the 133778
corps 133903
now 134042
began 134046
to 134106
reach 134188
the 134532
summit 135354
and 136108
as 136150
the 136324
report 136468
came 137516
from 137797
the 138845
extreme 138860
left 138870
that 139243
the 139751
enemy 140188
was 140196
stretching 140221
beyond 141208
our 142144
flank 142206
I 142325
sent 142468
Fairchild's 142794
brigade 144985
to 145330
assist 145878
our 145901
men 146700
there 146985
whilst 147140
Rodman 147328
took 147549
Harland's 147926
to 148395
the 148459
support 148574
of 148579
Willcox 148774
A 148925
staff 148957
officer 148981
now 150427
brought 150438
word 150617
that 151257
McClellan 152114
directed 154601
the 157150
whole 163690
line 163745
to 166856
advance 179265
At 179281
the 181773
left 181968
this 182066
could 1099
only 37053
mean 2367
to 131051
clear 1083
our 37037
front 9967
decisively 51771
of 89783
the 93316
enemy 172637
there 13255
for 65943
the 111644
slopes 3468
went 44851
steadily 63207
down 70310
to 72772
the 98139
Rohrersville 120437
road 123605
At 49410
the 87615
centre 122483
and 123307
right 3086
whilst 169592
we 5449
held 5689
Fox's 9678
Gap 11475
the 11703
high 11914
and 21679
rocky 26846
summit 28528
at 32902
the 38144
Mountain 38207
House 40879
was 41729
still 41843
in 45541
the 56104
enemy's 56164
possession 59251
The 61395
order 64196
came 67650
to 67670
me 67758
as 70208
senior 74554
officer 77457
upon 78578
the 84313
line 86056
and 98670
the 111724
signal 118169
was 125647
given 126756
On 128796
the 138227
left 138552
Longstreet's 138951
men 139277
were 141840
pushed 146634
down 150015
the 151317
mountain 151995
side 155718
beyond 156673
the 157979
Rohrersville 160319
and 161159
Sharpsburg 161166
roads 161325
and 161711
the 162057
contest 162905
there 163161
was 167859
ended 171421
The 174277
two 174347
hills 174584
between 177691
the 177706
latter 178889
road 179691
and 180076
the 180829
turnpike 182610
were 183774
still 183781
held 11247
by 27452
the 27536
enemy 28122
and 40796
the 60247
further 62900
one 85656
could 86492
not 126309
be 140014
reached 154856
till 155454
the 158725
Mountain 178827
House 179886
should 179889
be 180816
in 8513
our 11187
hands 25319
Sturgis 49590
and 54901
Willcox 75454
supported 116597
by 123131
Rodman 171471
again 13286
pushed 59392
forward 84238
but 142381
whilst 148053
they 158307
made 163750
progress 4771
they 16193
were 27014
baffled 124801
by 3670
a 4076
stubborn 55832
and 121628
concentrated 121792
resistance 142049
Reno 143116
had 173991
followed 9253
Rodman's 65334
division 96747
up 102406
the 26449
mountain 48023
and 58476
came 26541
to 44596
me 52978
a 121288
little 54359
before 144671
sunset 156613
anxious 77807
to 2248
know 126102
why 58383
the 89355
right 142362
could 149158
not 174503
get 5874
forward 70118
quite 184039
to 184211
the 184248
summit 184441
I 184446
explained 83864
that 3933
the 13637
ground 15554
there 16174
was 22511
very 23214
rough 32865
and 33770
rocky 36418
a 43346
fortress 45760
in 52003
itself 63580
and 73124
evidently 73715
very 74214
strongly 76969
held 83387
He 86949
passed 88929
on 90598
to 92862
Sturgis 107835
and 114524
it 120622
seemed 125477
to 133750
me 134324
he 139602
was 160872
hardly 164889
gone 170374
before 176909
he 185164
was 4228
brought 4571
back 10839
upon 29221
a 31639
stretcher 69016
dead 118299
He 122814
had 134146
gone 153162
to 58616
the 63893
skirmish 10610
line 31657
to 10590
examine 96974
for 9073
himself 156783
the 114333
situation 39266
and 82924
had 84301
been 145288
shot 153615
down 155813
by 157098
the 7271
enemy 36500
posted 102330
among 111506
the 126220
rocks 128834
and 141223
trees 143510
There 143903
was 144206
more 145617
or 6007
less 122160
firing 130318
on 64738
that 441
part 85118
of 87089
the 145851
field 154725
till 150833
late 56569
in 465
the 8022
evening 10374
but 30836
when 89799
morning 129956
dawned 175689
the 182133
Confederates 243
had 338
abandoned 4185
the 4402
last 4582
foothold 4912
above 4943
Turner's 5958
Gap 6468
and 7339
retreated 7618
by 7652
way 8107
of 8168
Boonsboro 9806
to 10020
Sharpsburg 10079
The 10224
casualties 10941
in 11053
the 11329
Ninth 11648
Corps 12040
had 13212
been 13229
of 13276
which 13500
were 13542
in 13658
the 13825
Kanawha 13857
division 13967
Some 13991
of 14090
the 14229
enemy 14263
were 14447
captured 14955
by 15061
my 15148
division 15345
and 15404
sent 16085
to 16411
the 16904
rear 17210
under 18224
guard 18495
On 18873
the 19031
north 19337
of 19502
the 19580
National 19731
road 20085
the 20522
First 20597
Corps 20993
under 21027
Hooker 22704
had 23363
been 23408
opposed 23566
by 23581
one 23735
of 24080
Hill's 24110
brigades 24655
and 24749
four 24900
of 24914
Longstreet's 24927
and 25048
had 25098
gradually 25581
worked 26242
its 27719
way 27745
along 27850
the 27953
old 30540
Hagerstown 30810
road 31217
crowning 31559
the 31671
heights 32638
in 32678
that 33840
direction 34668
after 34786
dark 34988
in 35077
the 35098
evening 35128
Gibbon's 35265
brigade 35785
had 35864
also 35879
advanced 35950
in 35973
the 36074
National 36091
road 36144
crowding 36244
up 36268
quite 36313
close 37715
to 38746
Turner's 38808
Gap 39607
and 40261
engaging 40722
the 41299
enemy 41938
in 42350
a 42383
lively 42556
combat 42643
It 42748
is 42850
not 42953
my 43203
purpose 43462
to 43549
give 43584
a 44137
detailed 44317
history 44386
of 44413
events 44437
which 44588
did 45916
not 46763
come 47098
under 47736
my 48475
own 48493
eye 48664
It 48756
is 48803
due 48874
to 48970
General 49204
Burnside 49698
however 52008
to 52323
note 52638
Hooker's 52681
conduct 52755
toward 53124
his 53251
immediate 53669
superior 53912
and 53991
his 54076
characteristic 54115
efforts 54124
to 54249
grasp 54261
all 54299
the 54475
glory 54575
of 56087
the 56803
battle 56887
at 56985
the 57042
expense 57058
of 57477
truth 57547
and 57650
of 57940
honorable 58156
dealing 58216
with 58268
his 58384
commander 58452
and 58473
his 58518
comrades 58699
Hooker's 59021
official 59168
report 59241
for 59581
the 60212
battle 60758
of 60996
South 61235
Mountain 63006
was 63552
dated 63637
at 63664
Washington 64663
November 65095
17th 65147
when 65231
Burnside 65383
was 65661
in 67272
command 67549
of 68034
the 68673
Army 69931
of 72668
the 73130
Potomac 73911
and 74732
when 74920
the 75193
intrigues 75347
of 75739
the 75999
former 76219
to 76367
obtain 77057
the 77680
command 78881
for 78920
himself 78984
were 79064
notorious 79466
and 80570
near 81930
their 82044
final 83744
success 83769
In 83809
it 84463
he 84696
studiously 84955
avoided 85464
any 85630
recognition 86113
of 86183
orders 89282
or 90333
directions 90412
received 90569
from 90752
Burnside 91082
and 92424
ignores 92581
his 93645
staff 93689
whilst 93777
he 93800
assumes 93893
that 94914
his 95282
orders 95352
came 95395
directly 95420
from 96567
McClellan 97378
and 97841
compliments 97950
the 97985
staff 98048
officers 98108
of 98204
the 99043
latter 99395
as 102239
if 104746
they 104968
had 105381
been 105757
the 106201
only 106298
means 106497
of 106593
communication 106622
This 106899
was 106960
not 107006
only 107023
insolent 107050
but 107210
a 107346
military 107412
offence 107620
had 107794
Burnside 107896
chosen 107907
to 108045
prosecute 108427
it 108492
He 108637
also 109264
asserts 109291
that 109616
the 109807
troops 109907
on 110119
our 110177
part 110295
of 110392
the 110441
line 110738
had 110798
been 111105
defeated 111259
and 111521
were 111690
at 111977
the 112000
turnpike 112507
at 114147

pass 20232
over 20567

their 31563
author 31804
but 34335
upon 36104
reflection 42586
I 44251
have 45684
felt 46078
it 46702
my 47035
duty 49993
to 50029
notice 50051

now 101743

West 118257
General 118286
Hooker 118584

up 129197
to 130015

corps 138769
was 139799
retiring 140935
from 141030

contest 144166
This 146202
is 147832

General 149161
Cox 149737
did 150720
not 153237
command 153961
a 154290
corps 154867
but 155136
a 156013
division 157424

that 160857
division 163185
was 163213

fighting 166559
most 166827
gallantly 167592
long 170798

General 175231
Hooker 176265
came 176877
up 177862

remained 178327
in 180042
the 28266
action 125292
all 1279
day 56658
never 56964
leaving 6313
the 20355
field 26679
for 29241
one 30168
moment 33603
He 36382
also 39878
says 43058
that 43189
he 43248
discovered 45347
that 48996
the 51801
attack 67195
by 71821
General 73025
Reno's 80174
corps 91488
was 91571
without 91747
sequence 92188
This 93009
is 93192
also 94408
untrue 94964
and 101047
when 101230
said 101391

on 117187

partakes 17138
of 18073
something 18328
worse 18587
than 18894
untruthfulness 19005
Every 19089

his 152714

the 63986
fact 12314
that 27766
Jackson 28051

not 74569

reduced 142176
Harper's 146610

marching 149875
to 39253
its 71435

Longstreet's 2423

all 150784
this 128299
it 129782
is 162847
very 169236
plain 164939
that 3243
if 110161
McClellan 175978

Franklin's 184067

as 54145
he 54898
could 69045

the 27199
Antietam 36938
If 39655
McClellan's 56531
force 80456
should 98855
prove 145539
overwhelming 146227
the 146930
past 155681
experience 161602
of 161753
the 166211
Confederate 3946
general 12556
encouraged 13824
him 28953
to 32143
believe 37138
that 58903
our 59208
advance 62075
would 157138
not 139889
be 89773
so 135252
enterprising 15330
that 24029
he 24760
could 147136
not 39711
make 52316
a 54274
safe 60850
retreat 115521
into 140054
Virginia 118560
He 124575
resolved 124671
therefore 2200
to 118889
halt 21560
at 88222
Sharpsburg 126012
which 381
offered 625
an 3520
excellent 4742
field 4774
for 4777
a 4966
defensive 5212
battle 5729
leaving 6807
himself 7548
free 7759
to 8029
resume 8039
his 8622
aggressive 9032
campaign 9417
or 9706
to 9798
retreat 9801
into 10398
Virginia 10504
according 11111
to 11730
the 12825

that 34732
the 34891

the 38924

It 58526
was 58607
now 59217
about 59424
three 59462
o'clock 59973
in 60187
the 60440
afternoon 60780
McClellan 61078
as 62009
it 64056
seemed 64109
had 65146
just 65159
reached 65472
the 65876
field 66035
and 66833
was 67330
surrounded 74008
by 74128
a 75734
group 76259
of 76496
his 77334
principal 79321
officers 79430
most 80109
of 81081
whom 81759
I 82121
had 83303
never 84560
seen 86928
before 87474
I 89451
rode 95025
up 95825
with 96185
General 96667
Burnside 97654
dismounted 98742
and 98822
was 98835
very 99237
cordially 99316
greeted 100207
by 100622
General 100653
McClellan 101327
He 107887
and 108785
Burnside 109504
were 114149
evidently 114240
on 117429
terms 117607
of 118425
most 118449
intimate 118476
friendship 120524
and 121359
familiarity 121368
He 122627
introduced 122988
me 124689
to 126026
the 127497
officers 129559
I 130963
had 133005
not 135106
known 138537

referring 140627
pleasantly 141326

me 153110
upon 154413
an 155419
easy 156460
footing 159840
with 159988
them 160236
in 160718
a 160869
very 161441
agreeable 161462
and 162027
genial 162821
way 164367
We 166690
walked 169253
up 170501
the 173389
slope 173916
of 174163
the 174580
ridge 175289
before 175601
us 176270
and 178141
looking 178791

whole 183014
field 183262

the 30476

Immediately 33485
in 73652

rising 166644
gently 173670
on 179180
both 59188

In 121859
the 122106
background 145628
on 151376
our 182347

was 878
the 1443

At 20980
its 21312

a 29555

the 49603

was 65749
closed 66250

between 70963
the 71065

prosperous 75015
a 88645

can 93295
easily 93311
be 94475

Illustration 95100
Map 95652
We 95916
made 96023
a 96131
large 96306
group 96374
as 96456
we 96508
stood 96701
upon 96899
the 97505
hill 97930
and 97998
it 98209
was 98286
not 98713
long 99494
before 100441
we 100564
attracted 128649
the 132872
enemy's 138057
attention 138125
A 141978
puff 142458
of 147799
white 158272
smoke 174447
from 175587
a 180447
knoll 181346
on 1165
the 44677
right 893
of 16253
the 1120
Sharpsburg 37074
road 50143
was 19667
followed 20907
by 175490
the 19752
screaming 20890
of 30666
a 30460
shell 149946
over 29609
our 30194
heads 37940
McClellan 68011
directed 76257
that 17762
all 17811
but 17998
one 18029
or 18110
two 18200
should 20214
retire 20449
behind 20762
the 20806
ridge 20963
while 22253
he 28825
continued 29795
the 29865
reconnoissance 30537
walking 34614
slowly 40313
to 50297
the 51032
right 52612
I 66442
think 66776
Fitz-John 68567
Porter 68611
was 80414
the 89754
only 90342
general 125497
officer 133297
who 133864
was 136695
retained 138385
as 138677
a 139974
companion 148261
in 150073
this 158464
walk 163875
I 173393
noted 174397
with 174708
satisfaction 175568
the 179526
cool 179623
and 180484
business-like 1521
air 73814
with 32394
which 49200
McClellan 161741
made 162351
his 163888
examination 163898
under 163945
fire 164884
The 165361
Confederate 166091
artillery 166157
was 166177
answered 166205
by 166231
a 167289
battery 171737
of 171915
ours 172055
and 172809
a 159294
lively 38584
cannonade 16559
ensued 22065
on 24704
both 25111
sides 25404
though 25545
without 26831
any 32784
noticeable 33003
effect 33145
The 33549
enemy's 33695
position 36732
was 47446
revealed 47620
and 49790
he 49953
was 59943
evidently 69512
in 69521
force 69892
on 71953
both 74296
sides 101242
of 101788
the 117181

the 6553

which 22011
hid 23157
his 25916
infantry 25970
from 32301
our 32681
sight 34062
The 35611
examination 36818
of 40134

noon 122384
of 124390
the 124401

The 67693

fourteen 4577

in 52066
line 52264
that 163589
day 11348
to 62530
oppose 62552
McClellan 90422
He 31548
was 19572
very 32321
strong 78830
in 95306
artillery 96676
however 106133
and 114965
his 155548

looked 6247
grimly 24857
over 31600
the 36147
hill-crests 36176
behind 51883
which 52139

for 25861
the 29357
protection 36211
of 37948
the 40432
left 40947
of 42717
the 42721
Confederate 44576
line 45004
and 51706
gave 52164
him 52580
in 55958
all 56640
the 58079
sixty 58638
or 58692
seventy 58739
guns 60607
which 61541
he 61975
speaks 62348
of 62798
in 64092
his 65116
report 65385
and 74854
which 79808
have 83642
puzzled 84906
several 88705
writers 89900
who 94156
have 100059
described 100263
the 102750
battle 103360
Whenever 106903
our 108724
troops 108759
showed 110524
themselves 110694
as 110722
they 110754
marched 111327
into 112914
position 113457
they 114318
were 114478
saluted 114528
from 119070
shotted 119097
cannon 120209
and 120413
the 121279
numerous 121573
batteries 122246
that 123562
were 124461
developed 124847
on 124966
the 126772
long 126785
line 129491
of 129549
hills 132865
before 135218
us 135464
no 136398
doubt 137698
did 141779
much 143326
to 144627
impress 144638
McClellan 145227
with 146073
the 148078
belief 148256
that 148454
he 151935
had 152610
the 152627
great 152634
bulk 152656
of 154435
Lee's 154990
army 155063
before 156035
him 156716
The 160212
value 160228
of 160598
time 160912
was 161720
one 161726
of 161735
the 161751
things 162781
McClellan 162803
never 168845
understood 168860
He 171067
should 171152
have 171595
been 174379
among 175848
the 175857
first 176370
in 176503
the 177928
saddle 178222
at 178249
every 180029
step 180056
in 180150
the 182898
campaign 183359
after 183514
he 183568
was 183759
in 183803
possession 183926
of 184021
Lee's 184142
order 184443
of 130668
the 13939
9th 75105
and 6934
should 16706
have 16771
infused 17115
energy 18760
into 32980
every 60066
unit 7610
in 9109
his 9324
army 9791
Instead 58982
of 58051
making 36364
his 27543
reconnoissance 51508
at 134729
three 35970
in 36467
the 51456
afternoon 51618
of 1058
Monday 29133
it 15688
might 28089
have 81310
been 94670
made 127004
at 139251
ten 142644
in 142663
the 62551
morning 175
and 223
the 277
battle 439
could 464
have 500
been 1572
fought 2945
before 3985
night 4222
if 4275
indeed 5097
Lee 5226
had 5249
not 5309
promptly 5527
retreated 5564
when 5574
support 5590
from 5775
Jackson 6535
would 6855
thus 8021
have 8106
become 8311
impossible 9114
Or 9657
if 9683
McClellan 10305
had 10373
pushed 10392
boldly 10468
for 10484
the 10691
bridge 11213
at 12444
the 12460
mouth 12745
of 12833
the 12845
Antietam 12860
nothing 14308
but 14606
a 15212
precipitate 15386
retreat 15592
by 21898
Lee 21906
could 21915
have 22051
prevented 22155
the 22230
interposition 22337
of 22345
the 22488
whole 22860
National 22897
army 23143
between 23248
the 23282
separated 23307
wings 23317
of 23497
the 23676
Confederates 24230
The 24251
opportunity 25212
was 26628
still 26719
supremely 26817
favorable 26889
for 26926
McClellan 26997
but 27018
prompt 27163
decision 27180
was 27237
not 27265
easy 27313
for 27321
him 27344
Nothing 27429
but 27466
reconnoitring 27566
was 27571
done 27626
on 27649
Monday 27702
afternoon 27775
or 27830
on 27903
Tuesday 27915
whilst 28022
Lee 28106
was 28471
straining 28480
every 28556
nerve 28584
to 28675
concentrate 28701
his 28749
forces 28964
and 28977
to 29042
correct 30593
what 30725
would 30735
have 30835
proven 32138
a 32165
fatal 32606
blunder 32887
in 32901
scattering 32938
them 33195
had 33231
his 33289
opponent 33567
acted 33583
with 33657
vigor 33766
The 33775
strongest 33976
defence 34631
the 34644
eulogists 34779
of 34874
the 34918
Confederate 34969
general 35049
have 35656
made 35718
for 35820
him 35848
is 35854
that 36041
he 36051
perfectly 36235
understood 36446
McClellan's 36620
caution 36739
and 36819
calculated 36878
with 36907
confidence 36931
upon 36968
it 36986
that 37001
he 37840
would 37985
have 38012
been 38070
at 38194
liberty 38237
to 38318
perfect 38389
his 38404
combinations 38481
still 39216
more 39556
at 39612
leisure 39633
but 39770
for 39862
the 40784
accident 40916
by 41140
which 41152
the 41339
copy 41414
of 41436
his 41451
plan 41459
had 41538
fallen 41588
into 41594
our 41714
hands 42434
at 42533
Frederick 43005
City 43179
During 43202
the 43752
16th 43764
we 43969
confidently 44213
expected 44255
a 44269
battle 44278
and 45200
I 45699
kept 46212
with 46809
my 47311
division 47337
In 47921
the 48395
afternoon 48559
I 48578
saw 48630
General 48642
Burnside 49048
and 49398
learned 49439
from 49556
him 49599
that 50345
McClellan 50664
had 50710
determined 50728
to 50765
let 50892
Hooker 51147
make 51427
a 51892
movement 51961
on 51964
our 52022
extreme 52727
right 52821
to 53024
turn 53231
Lee's 53303
position 53442
Burnside's 53623
manner 54010
in 54067
speaking 54140
of 54186
this 54200
implied 54712
that 54715
he 54881
thought 54905
it 54995
was 55885
done 56276
at 56290
Hooker's 56297
solicitation 56333
and 56405
through 56430
his 56521
desire 56533
openly 57363
evinced 58754
to 60181
be 60952
independent 61093
in 61546
command 62627
I 62634
urged 62653
Burnside 63040
to 63105
assume 63350
the 65345
immediate 66207
command 66973
of 66988
the 68487
corps 69189
and 69595
allow 69633
me 69648
to 70621
lead 70871
my 71559
own 71615
division 71877
He 72801
objected 73660
that 73673
as 73876
he 74446
had 74638
been 75477
announced 75501
as 76010
commander 76150
of 76301
the 76362
right 76374
wing 76404
of 76533
the 76608
army 76953
composed 76994
of 77721
the 77768
two 77777
corps 77780
he 77800
was 77987
unwilling 78183
to 78198
waive 79577
his 79640
precedence 79748
or 80087
to 80099
assume 80255
that 80261
Hooker 80284
was 80347
detached 80474
for 80943
anything 81189
more 81212
than 81352
a 81746
temporary 82515
purpose 82788
I 82917
pointed 83028
out 83172
that 83199
Reno's 83378
staff 83406
had 84614
been 84754
granted 84778
leave 84787
of 84846
absence 85068
to 85613
take 85626
the 88683
body 88715
of 88785
their 89235
chief 89798
to 90177
Washington 90455
and 90472
that 90673
my 91333
division 91676
staff 91857
was 92800
too 93644
small 93923
for 93960
corps 94029
duty 94329
but 94735
he 94928
met 94939
this 94955
by 96858
saying 97181
that 97199
he 97207
would 97241
use 97254
his 97334
staff 97436
for 97494
this 97736
purpose 98440
and 98522
help 98536
me 99093
in 99100
every 99117
way 99161
he 100552
could 100672
till 101944
the 102018
crisis 102087
of 113190
the 113206
campaign 113374
should 113404
be 113421
over 113506
Sympathizing 113510
with 113521
his 113529
very 114216
natural 114774
feeling 115202
I 117236
ceased 117366
objecting 117909
and 118654
accepted 118684
with 118997
as 119319
good 119442
grace 120291
as 120348
I 120351
could 120356
the 120391
unsatisfactory 120904
position 121100
of 122632
nominal 122736
commander 122803
of 122812
the 126418
corps 126466
to 126535
which 126761
I 127199
was 127270
a 129771
comparative 131129
stranger 131231
and 131312
which 131342
under 131695
the 133738
circumstances 133744
naturally 133792
looked 133805
to 133825
him 133909
as 134060
its 134091
accustomed 134113
and 134136
real 134174
commander 134195
Burnside's 134264
intentions 134405
in 134507
respect 134579
to 134584
myself 134591
were 134799
thoroughly 134826
friendly 134836
as 135322
he 135326
afterward 136470
proved 136552
and 136560
I 136918
had 137288
no 137543
ground 137694
for 138656
complaint 139057
on 139079
this 139105
score 139129
but 139140
the 139205
position 139347
of 139744
second 139777
in 140110
command 140184
is 140238
always 140311
an 140516
awkward 140633
and 141393
anomalous 141505
one 141673
and 142121
such 142136
I 142207
felt 142289
it 142318
The 142351
16th 142683
passed 142833
without 145007
serious 145080
fighting 145340
though 146636
we 146711
had 147876
desultory 147909
cannonading 148398
and 148420
picket 148619
firing 148638
It 148677
was 148681
hard 148685
to 148702
restrain 148725
our 148747
men 148787
from 148823
showing 148842
themselves 148911
on 148959
the 148984

front 151171
of 151177
us 152110
and 152612
whenever 152692
they 153407
did 154881
so 154920
they 157133
drew 157145
the 163340
fire 163704
from 163721
some 166755
of 169810
the 170305
enemy's 170641
batteries 170812
to 170819
which 178640
ours 181766
would 181953
respond 181957
McClellan 182024
reconnoitred 182132
the 182176
line 182194
of 182205
the 182229
Antietam 5153

The 64020
selected 64038
positions 60256
were 88266
marked 4166
by 5942
McClellan's 7761
engineers 11080

elsewhere 40318
Corps 52920

duty 41674

a 102781

what 173397
is 5920
known 48245
of 60437
the 101139
enemy 29649

be 121620
put 143266
upon 146894
his 147292

have 4842
freedom 5757

The 92577
changes 121594
made 137316
were 152996
as 161961

Rodman's 169718

Crook's 52509
going 56708
with 56795
Sturgis 70521
Crook 78050
was 80700
ordered 81356
to 102167
take 112671
the 120800
advance 133270
in 148175
crossing 155760
the 157024

we 170229
should 170847
be 10213
ordered 27417
to 28276
attack 62226
This 83851
selection 83858
was 104720
made 106906
by 114187
Burnside 115715
himself 128362
as 141560
a 149749
compliment 154961
to 160069
the 175207
division 177540
for 179573
the 50393
vigor 166423
of 166727
its 23447
assault 29257
at 32823
South 65988
Mountain 134239
While 140605
we 24394
were 25349
moving 32850
we 38001
heard 41981
Hooker's 43994
guns 66087
far 67159
off 70926
on 77399
the 135521
right 136260
and 136383
front 137041
and 139228
the 175643
cannonade 1840
continued 1957
an 1985
hour 3035
or 3145
more 3184
after 3241
it 4616
became 6749
dark 8344
What 13302
then 15091
was 15414
the 16543
plan 17544
of 17646
battle 18077
of 18520
which 20486
the 20888
first 21708
step 23190
was 23539
this 30269
movement 31161
of 33143
Hooker's 33225
McClellan's 33493
dispositions 33699
on 35081
the 35580
15th 36228
were 38111
made 42293
whilst 43770
Franklin's 43784
corps 46202
was 46265
still 46936
absent 47188
and 47416
under 47668
the 47920
orders 48250
he 49493
received 50396
was 51437
likely 55320
to 55368

Sumner's 82561
two 82567
corps 82731
had 83193
been 88972
treated 89820
as 90188
the 92720

the 93151
army 93265
in 93306
hand 93425
Burnside's 95344
had 95474
been 95832
divided 97522
by 97903
putting 98623
Hooker 99488
on 100469
the 100486

Porter's 107610
corps 108367
was 109138
in 110274
reserve 110761
This 111114
looked 111182
as 111348
if 111769
a 113924
general 114210
attack 117212
in 119172
front 120732
with 127962
this 128966
organization 131593
of 132046
the 132205
army 135503
were 136693
intended 138100
But 139416
the 140562
more 144313
McClellan 144968
examined 148026
the 148259
enemy's 150510
position 158703
the 159541
less 159577
inclined 162374
he 162384
was 163430
to 164435
attack 164500
the 164647
centre 164871
He 167339
could 168071
cross 168614
the 169450
bridge 169879
there 171581
and 171651
on 172244
the 175255
right 175880
and 175919
deploy 175976
but 176147
the 176717
gentle 178178
slopes 178555
rising 180943
toward 181081
Sharpsburg 43711
were 53706
swept 110532
by 112474
formidable 125415
batteries 151477
and 180442
offered 10075
no 45749
cover 81749
to 117378
advancing 134617
troops 14160
The 14323
enemy's 14788
infantry 15431
was 17952
behind 19632
stone 20173
fences 21232
and 22698
in 26677
sunken 26868
roads 28699
whilst 29532
ours 30466
must 32280
advance 34055
over 44741
the 46915
open 54577
Lee's 59890
right 61835
rested 64954
upon 67496
the 75329
wooded 78965
bluffs 84170
above 86205
the 92486
Burnside 95063
bridge 95720
where 96168
it 96593
could 97341
only 97527
be 98019
approached 100377
by 101150
a 101234
small 104067
head 105302
of 106435
column 107131
charging 107716
along 108608
the 109094
narrow 114251
roadway 115536
under 115624
a 115847
concentrated 118377
fire 119588
of 121966
cannon 124330
and 124500
small 125685
arms 127284
No 134627
point 135832
of 147243
attack 150602
on 159970
the 160057
whole 160966
field 165483
was 166618
so 168724
unpromising 168754
as 169474
this 172426
Then 173653
as 174030
Jackson 179967
was 182720
still 10502
at 70008
Harper's 96777
Ferry 7844
there 29358
was 30296
the 56641
contingency 59132
of 60608
an 62244
attack 63206
in 66488
rear 74901
if 85090
anything 106837
less 110128
than 116319
the 119098
mass 137656
of 143716
our 150359
army 174081
were 185394
pushed 4093
beyond 5405
Lee's 5450
right 7955
On 9587
our 15698
right 16487
in 17285
front 26049
of 27863
Hooker 31206
it 41511
was 44304
easy 46671
to 47854
turn 51629
the 52791
Confederate 53108
line 55293
The 56078
road 57369
from 57445
Keedysville 57598
through 59384
Smoketown 61006

the 75862
Antietam 78396
in 81485
a 89517
hollow 94762
out 103087
of 112282
the 113007
line 113749
of 124808
fire 125249
and 131648
a 135341
march 136285
around 138581
Lee's 148284
left 149768
flank 149826
could 149876
be 150716
made 152708
almost 156198
wholly 157266
under 158062
cover 158414
The 159215
topography 161005
of 161299
the 163030
field 166853
therefore 178209
suggested 179312
a 179736
flank 180903
attack 180984
from 154944
our 69187
right 161846
if 1661
the 7979
National 12791
commander 12823
rejected 13470
the 15798
better 15859
strategy 29597
of 33407
interposing 52714
his 56241
army 58716
between 59164
Lee 63305
and 64674
Jackson 73768
as 80026
too 81032
daring 83605
a 86372
movement 103594
This 115172
flank 115313
attack 123176
McClellan 123629
determined 131248
to 133717
make 139200
and 139473
some 142195
time 147936
after 148335
noon 149276
of 157994
the 160883
16th 161996
issued 170459
his 178427
orders 180990
accordingly 81856
In 87610
his 165047
preliminary 7897
report 10379
of 16504
the 32897
battle 34032
made 34949
before 38757
he 47270
was 56821
relieved 58661
from 75778
command 77053
McClellan 85496
says 89126
The 91031
design 96743
was 109067
to 113355
make 117466
the 119630
main 123377
attack 123781
upon 133452
the 134692
enemy's 136184
left 137196
--at 139024
least 139046
to 139326
create 146193
a 147213
diversion 176063
in 184814
favor 5568
of 6463
the 6489
main 7564
attack 13342
with 34783
the 58388
hope 59708
of 68582
something 68618
more 71485
by 72308
assailing 77294
the 77895
enemy's 90748
right 105734
--and 128358
as 134797
soon 138804
as 27025
one 57528
or 68029
both 63088
of 16198
the 118117
flank 121605
movements 161215
were 61988
fully 74620
successful 82993
to 128538
attack 150863

The 175203

I 179586
got 179841
from 182355

at 377

fairly 10970
consistent 11196
with 12451
the 13583
design 15519
first 15664
quoted 15816
namely 16029
that 23781

the 24739

Sumner 28829
Hooker 34044

Franklin 34370
should 36873
be 37147
progressing 40294
favorably 45617
we 49695
were 50928
to 51276
create 52401
a 52605
diversion 53885
in 54160
favor 56695
of 57332
the 57854
main 58173
attack 58177
with 58287
the 58611
hope 58696
of 61797
something 62106
more 62172
It 62293
is 62345
also 63360
probable 64697
that 65804
Hooker's 67021
movement 67041
was 69232
at 69834
first 74056
intended 74071
to 78469

up 102317

shared 133555

he 134867
reached 135401
the 135411

in 135690

thus 135756
making 136133
a 136155
simultaneous 136443
oblique 136493
attack 137244
from 137592
our 139904

the 144250
whole 144412

Porter's 146778
corps 146868

the 147825
Ninth 148216

It 16071
is 20104
hardly 32988
disputable 1557
that 3111
this 3685

have 10777

plan 23194

the 28327
one 35380
actually 36925

out 54150
Certainly 73376
the 73647
assumption 73850
that 75082
the 75309

could 83095

Twelfth 97601
Corps 97638
troops 97648
Sumner 97671
saw 97695
and 97780
he 97842
led 97864
Sedgwick's 97894
men 97928
to 97941
the 97986
right 98002
of 98044
these 98075
Ignorant 98117
as 98145
he 98388
necessarily 98414
was 98426
of 98434
what 98452
had 98466
occurred 98471
before 98529
he 98563
assumed 98569
that 98572
he 98587
formed 98601
on 98604
the 98611
extreme 98634
right 98660
of 98671
the 98697
Twelfth 98711
Corps 98723
and 98731
that 98734
he 98747
fronted 98838
in 98877
the 98881
same 98886
direction 98898
as 98907
Hooker 98921
had 98924
done 98927
This 98933
misconception 98951
of 98976
the 99006
situation 99013
led 99028
him 99041
into 99073
another 99082
error 99095
He 99105
had 99113
seen 99116
only 99174
stragglers 99282
and 99297
wounded 99308
men 99333
on 99339
the 99396
line 99421
of 99432
his 99469
own 99492
advance 99553
and 99562
hence 99580
concluded 99601
that 99618
Hooker's 99656
Corps 99673
was 99681
completely 99702
dispersed 99708
and 99748
its 99764
division 99795
and 99825
brigade 99867
organizations 99901
broken 99922
up 99935
He 99966

original 107077

Sumner 107502
to 107519
his 107583
position 107661

beginning 108158

the 139159

of 139208
approach 139217
to 139226
the 139231
stone 139259

All 139282
were 139285
then 139290
to 139301
remain 139314
in 139325
readiness 139329
to 139390
obey 139421
further 139438
orders 139471
When 139530
these 139543
arrangements 139579
had 139587
been 139609
made 139653
I 139675
rode 139681
to 139693
the 139697
position 139716
Burnside 139737
had 139746
selected 139840
for 139847
himself 139902
which 139907
was 139959
upon 140007
a 140026
high 140040
knoll 140073
northeast 140081
of 140222
the 140226
Burnside 140240
bridge 140304
near 140357
a 140363
haystack 140368
which 140373
was 140379
a 140392
prominent 140398
landmark 140416
Near 140424
by 140426
was 140430
Benjamin's 140448
battery 140463
of 140474
twenty-pounder 140479
Parrotts 140485
and 140493
a 140497
little 140505
further 140539
still 140552
to 140632
the 140653
right 140680
on 140693
the 140703
same 140710
ridge 140716
General 140729
Sturgis 140757
had 140767
sent 140800
in 140808
Durell's 140818
battery 140821

Ibid 140877
These 140895
were 141015
exchanging 141049
shots 141053
with 141061
the 141076
enemy's 141092
guns 141115
opposite 141134
and 141142
had 141170
the 141176
advantage 141185
in 141224
range 141240
and 141256
weight 141295
of 141303
metal 141324
At 141330
this 141359
point 141361
I 141366
remained 141371
until 141422
the 141431
order 141463
for 141478
our 141504
attack 141531
came 141561
later 141596
in 141609
the 141685
day 141714
We 141772
anxiously 141784
watched 141792
what 141801
we 141818
could 141841
see 141857
at 141884
the 141901
right 141920
and 141937
noted 141950
the 141961
effect 141969
of 141987
the 142030
fire 142039
of 142059
the 142072
heavy 142082
guns 142094
of 142111
Benjamin's 142120
battery 142129
We 142141
could 142152
see 142158
nothing 142161
distinctly 142199
that 142222
occurred 142244
beyond 142251
the 142255
Dunker 142266
Church 142300
for 142334
the 142368
East 142390
and 142417
West 142420
Woods 142425
with 142440
farm-houses 142452
and 142457
orchards 142497
between 142521
made 142537
an 142543
impenetrable 142548
screen 142619
A 142625
column 142689
of 142692
smoke 142757
stood 142760
over 142777
the 142790
burning 142798
Mumma 142804
house 142832
marking 142840
plainly 142888
its 142902
situation 142905
As 142928
the 142935
morning 142968
wore 142972
on 142975
we 142992
saw 142996
lines 143026
of 143061
troops 143087
advancing 143094
from 143100
our 143136
right 143141
upon 143150
the 143162
other 143249
side 143262
of 143274
the 143287
Antietam 143292
and 143296
engaging 143310
the 143321
enemy 143345
between 143359
us 143365
and 143382
the 143389
East 143397
Wood 143422
The 143437
Confederate 143442
lines 143466
facing 143499
them 143514
now 143532
also 143545
rose 143558
into 143588
view 143618
From 143641
our 143649
position 143688
we 143710
looked 143720
as 143729
it 143742
were 143752
down 143779
between 143795
the 143888
opposing 143904
lines 143942
as 143951
if 143958
they 143988
had 143991
been 143999
the 144008
sides 144046
of 144127
a 144130
street 144157
and 144177
as 144183
the 144207
fire 144231
opened 144249
we 144265
saw 144276
wounded 144279
men 144293
carried 144319
to 144370
the 144399
rear 144405
and 144414
stragglers 144475
making 144518
off 144543
Our 144549
lines 144561
halted 144579
and 144584
we 144604
were 144620
tortured 144631
with 144634
anxiety 144661
as 144666
we 144680
speculated 144716
whether 144731
our 144742
men 144748
would 144751
charge 144755
or 144762
retreat 144778
The 144795
enemy 144802
occupied 144877
lines 144920
of 144939
fences 144943
and 144971
stone 144991
walls 144995
and 145003
their 145006
batteries 145022
made 145041
gaps 145060
in 145072
the 145136
National 145146
ranks 145197
Our 145216
long-range 145230
guns 145242
were 145289
immediately 145292
turned 145334
in 145343
that 145355
direction 145371
and 145380
we 145385
cheered 145395
every 145407
well-aimed 145458
shot 145474
One 145493
of 145521
our 145562
shells 145577
blew 145591
up 145595
a 145618
caisson 145631
close 145637
to 145698
the 145752
Confederate 145765
line 145774
This 145790
contest 145798
was 145870
going 145883
on 145885
and 145938
it 145956
was 145959
yet 145975
uncertain 145980
which 146006
would 146015
succeed 146035
when 146065
one 146112
of 146125
McClellan's 146133
staff 146143
rode 146165
up 146181
with 146219
an 146234
order 146251
to 146263
Burnside 146297
The 146301
latter 146304
turned 146370
to 146372
me 146380
saying 146387
we 146405
were 146432
ordered 146447
to 146465
make 146472
our 146475
attack 146485
I 146513
left 146522
the 146534
hill-top 146558
at 146568
once 146580
to 146594
give 146603
personal 146609
supervision 146644
to 146654
the 146662
movement 146668
ordered 146710
and 146759
did 146766
not 146774
return 146781
to 146788
it 146794
My 146824
knowledge 146844
by 146856
actual 146884
vision 146892
of 146915
what 146934
occurred 146946
on 146949
the 146964
right 146981
ceased 147008
The 147073
question 147090
at 147106
what 147131
hour 147156
Burnside 147161
received 147170
this 147188
order 147205
has 147214
been 147233
warmly 147246
disputed 147253
The 147256
manner 147264
in 147269
which 147290
we 147302
had 147342
waited 147352
the 147355
free 147390
discussion 147398
of 147415
what 147423
was 147428
occurring 147460
under 147535
our 147554
eyes 147588
and 147663
of 147666
our 147694
relation 147697
to 147702

the 147931
usual 147945
and 147998
business-like 148018
form 148046
all 148098
forbid 148105
the 148125
supposition 148127
that 148143
this 148148
was 148151
any 148201
reiteration 148209
of 148228
a 148251

I 148344
leave 148348
this 148381
as 148403
originally 148412
written 148447
although 148486
the 148505
order 148514
itself 148667
has 148670
since 148694
come 148700
to 148722
light 148724
for 148733
the 148739
discussion 148786
of 148836
the 148863
circumstantial 148878
evidence 148882
may 148893
be 148940
useful 148964
in 148976
determining 149024
the 149062
value 149068
of 149088
McClellan's 149102
report 149106
of 149112

it 149145

that 157555
about 157561
ten 157565

the 157614

the 157632

of 157828
Sedgwick's 157847

not 157907
easily 157917
accounted 157933
for 157949
and 157959
with 157972
McClellan's 157980
theory 157995
of 158001
the 158014
enormous 158047
superiority 158064
of 158068
Lee's 158086
numbers 158099
it 158106
looked 158136
as 158140
if 158152
the 158179
Confederate 158200
general 158209
had 158217
massed 158225

our 158294

Sumner's 158308
notion 158332
that 158345
Hooker's 158361

was 158426
utterly 158454
dispersed 158492
was 158496
naturally 158541
accepted 158553
and 158565
McClellan 158622
limited 158634
his 158683

holding 158743

Hooker's 159118

massed 159223
and 159226
supported 159236
by 159240
the 159295
troops 159316

had 159419

rallied 159458
there 159480
Franklin's 159493
corps 159534
as 159560
it 159575
came 159631
on 159637
the 159706

detained 159774
to 159788

the 159802

further 160012

the 160158
Ninth 160167

At 160176
this 160185
time 160222
therefore 160273
he 160290
gave 160301
his 160320

to 160414
Burnside 160429

Antietam 160541
and 160576
attack 160611
the 160620
enemy 160631
thus 160675
creating 160699
a 160723
diversion 160812
in 160827
favor 160884
of 160929
our 160933
hard-pressed 160945

of 161125
the 161131
battle 161232
dated 161250
October 161253

Burnside 161712

death 174774
He 174779
was 174781
content 174786
to 174794
have 174814
stated 174850
the 174864
fact 174882
as 174933

knew 175008

the 175136

of 175215
debating 175247
it 175258
The 175263
circumstances 175377
have 175384
satisfied 175411
me 175423
that 175434
his 175451
accuracy 175454
in 175540
giving 175543
the 175584

Footnote 175756
Upon 175781
reflection 175787
I 175790
think 175804
it 175884
probable 175887
that 175898
the 175916
order 175928
from 175931
McClellan 175938
was 175972
read 175979
to 176014
me 176024
and 176125
that 176127
I 176132
thus 176134
got 176175
the 176179
hour 176196
of 176218
its 176271
date 176295
connected 176308
in 176337
my 176392
mind 176395
with 176425
the 176472
beginning 176580
of 176588
our 176621
attack 176633
It 176687
will 176693
not 176698
be 176739
wondered 176832
at 176845
therefore 176905
if 176984
to 177016
my 177045
mind 177070
the 177109
story 177117
of 177123
the 177139
eight 177161
o'clock 177201
order 177231
is 177238
an 177242
instance 177260
of 177277
the 177288
way 177330
in 177352
which 177356
an 177401
erroneous 177411
recollection 177421
is 177489
based 177513
upon 177522
the 177541
desire 177544
to 177547
make 177564
the 177583
facts 177598
accord 177632
with 177646
a 177653
theory 177692
The 177707
actual 177715
time 177730
must 177760
have 177773
been 177807
as 177827
much 177834
later 177860
than 177877
nine 177887
o'clock 177895
as 177898
the 178067
period 178077
during 178100
which 178103
with 178107
absorbed 178116
attention 178132
we 178154
had 178196
been 178217
watching 178234
the 178256
battle 178267
on 178272
the 178304
right 178317
--a 178332
period 178357
it 178428
is 178449
safe 178499
to 178501
say 178504
much 178564
longer 178576
than 178581
it 178622
seemed 178632
to 178642
us 178649
The 178673
judgment 178676
of 178699
the 178769
hour 178785
which 178792
I 178797
gave 178808
in 178846
my 178852
report 178890
was 178927
merely 178942
my 178949
impression 178953
from 178964
passing 179001
events 179016
for 179041
I 179049
hastened 179073
at 179090
once 179102
to 179105
my 179112
own 179122
duties 179137
without 179149
thinking 179177
to 179198
look 179236
at 179255
my 179295
watch 179320
whilst 179334
the 179348
cumulative 179369
evidence 179375
seems 179379
to 179386
prove 179437
conclusively 179448
that 179485
the 179496
time 179518
stated 179531
by 179574
Burnside 179631
and 179643

McClellan 179666
himself 179692
in 179706
his 179741

From 83807
the 84461
nature 89682
of 90294
the 92928
ground 98659
on 99402
the 100621
other 100663
side 101320
the 101351
enemy 102308
were 107063
compelled 107765
to 109507
approach 110461
mainly 111491
by 115305
the 115665
road 116710
which 118551
led 120238
up 120729
the 121406
river 121459
near 121623
three 122526
hundred 122695
paces 124015
parallel 127919
with 128187
my 129562
line 130393
of 134374
battle 135426
and 135940
distant 136462
therefrom 139160
from 139821
fifty 141181
to 141302
a 141329
hundred 143444
and 143633
fifty 143721
feet 144043
thus 144233
exposing 144796
his 145336
flank 145496
to 145706
a 145751
destructive 145940
fire 146371
the 147053
most 149031
of 149416
that 149799
distance 149825
Under 150591
such 150724
circumstances 151815
the 151952
Confederate 152209
position 154471
was 155499
nearly 156787
impregnable 158686
against 159664
a 159860
direct 159924
attack 160521
over 160700
the 163626
bridge 168796
for 168869
the 168879
column 168911
approaching 168927
it 169343
was 171371
not 174899
only 176094
exposed 181685
at 181830
almost 182027
pistol-range 1295
to 56674
the 2502
perfectly 140418
covered 16073
infantry 72752
of 77774
the 145658
enemy 147009
and 179258
to 520
two 1593
batteries 2246
which 12373
were 21234
assigned 34234
to 49778
the 52238
special 56584
duty 57192
of 57530
supporting 65637
Toombs 68130
having 80964
the 85486
exact 87700
range 88003
of 93273
the 97208
little 97229
valley 98582
with 98786
their 98792
shrapnel 98909
but 112420
if 112803
it 112835
should 120989
succeed 123410
in 126100
reaching 126288
the 126304
bridge 126400
its 129684
charge 130033
across 145507
it 148155
must 150487
be 150586
made 151011
under 151162
a 157049
fire 164786
ploughing 170584
through 177820
its 183745
length 183750
the 185031
head 26612
of 121442
the 128433
column 155389
melting 155749
away 168659
as 175116
it 20511
advanced 55875
so 154167
that 59442
as 143421
every 5026
soldier 7755
knows 39055
it 49180
could 57184
show 58627
no 73733
front 83418
strong 83562
enough 89260
to 89412
make 89686
an 122169
impression 122962
upon 123745
the 130482
enemy's 142002
breastworks 149588
even 151001
if 152070
it 157051
should 185366
reach 2591
the 6009
other 13426
side 31825
As 32102
a 32417
desperate 33678
sort 36939
of 53717
diversion 53786
in 57177
favor 57962
of 58726
the 60268
right 60423
wing 62528
it 62796
might 64884
be 67027
justifiable 75042
but 81336
I 93068
believe 93178
that 93199
no 94001
officer 94414
or 94713
man 94875
who 94972
knew 95003
the 97177
actual 98481
situation 100321
at 101493
that 123818
bridge 123847
thinks 126426
that 126446
a 126796
serious 127292
attack 130774
upon 135544
it 137621
was 138729
any 140507
part 146785
of 147528
McClellan's 147537
original 149388
plan 149445
Yet 150196
in 153068
his 158662
detailed 170116
report 176780
of 182597
instead 184779
of 38807
speaking 52674
of 58215
it 61969
as 62012
the 107404
difficult 122326
task 150876
the 50712
original 50994
report 22433
had 54698
called 58349
it 61379
he 122775
treats 133190
it 143845
as 88
little 725
different 739
from 871
a 891
parade 945
or 1148
march 1163
across 1620
which 1769
might 1901
have 1923
been 1931
done 1956
in 1996
half 2005
an 2049
hour 2068
Burnside's 2097
view 2183
of 2213
the 2218
matter 2272
was 2468
that 2671
the 3009
front 3172
attack 3269
at 3300
the 3314
bridge 3375
was 3448
so 3833
difficult 3979
that 4032
the 4252
passage 4521
by 4706
the 5346
ford 5370
below 5443
must 5761
be 5997
an 6115
important 6416
factor 6873
in 7045
the 7071
task 7820
for 8020
if 8115
Rodman's 8351
division 8427
should 8476
succeed 8504
in 8608
getting 8781
across 9290
there 9299
at 9748
the 10052
bend 10061
of 10152
the 10169
Antietam 10246
he 10276
would 10351
come 10391
up 10470
in 10585
rear 10868
of 10920
Toombs 11282
and 11420
either 11613
the 11678
whole 12113
of 12225
D 12259
R 12318
Jones's 12838
division 12943
would 12947
have 13147
to 13914
advance 14121
to 14749
meet 15120
Rodman 15436
or 15485
Toombs 15600
must 16231
abandon 16251
the 16320
bridge 16364
In 16413
this 16434
I 16483
certainly 16601
concurred 16783
and 16876
Rodman 16885
was 16894
ordered 17065
to 17303
push 17310
rapidly 17347
for 17453
the 17469
ford 17915
It 17927
is 17955
important 17968
to 17978
remember 18002
however 18034
that 18086
Walker's 18104
Confederate 18194
division 18306
had 18312
been 18444
posted 18514
during 18555
the 18639
earlier 18645
morning 18973
to 19009
hold 19069
that 19133
part 19190
of 19249
the 19384
Antietam 19652
line 19712
supporting 19720
Toombs 19726

and 21138
it 21549
was 21780
probably 21817
from 22020
him 22111
that 22660
Rodman 22807
suffered 22835
the 22914
first 22987
casualties 23037
that 23072
occurred 23138
in 23180
his 23254
ranks 23274
But 23401
as 23419
we 23527
have 23573
seen 23637
Walker 23678
had 23814
been 23927
called 23995
away 24057
by 24073
Lee 24562
only 24570
an 24588
hour 24775
before 24984
and 25115
had 25143
made 25160
the 25197
hasty 25201
march 25240
by 25324
the 25341
rear 25367
of 25391
Sharpsburg 25589
to 25663
fall 25680
upon 25793
Sedgwick 25983
If 26058
therefore 26153
Rodman 26256
had 26297
been 26331
sent 26766
to 26875
cross 27114
at 27255
eight 27307
o'clock 27477
it 27616
is 27914
safe 27962
to 28604
say 29192
that 29397

the 30279
face 30288

Walker's 30768

division 31007
would 31149
never 31316
have 31517
reached 32185
the 32225
further 32464
bank 32729
--a 32767
contingency 32952
that 33075
McClellan 33140
did 33554
not 33558
consider 33670
when 33848
arguing 34095
long 34112

the 34319
favorable 34762
results 34909
that 34926
might 35324
have 35455
followed 35536
an 35565
earlier 35758
attack 35796
As 35875
Rodman 35891
died 36156
upon 36374
the 36454
field 36579
no 36654
full 36681
report 37178
for 37222
his 37328
division 37335
was 37652
made 37883
and 38077
we 38137
only 38157
know 38193
that 39279
he 39552
met 39568
with 39723
some 39906
resistance 40034
from 40472
both 40700
infantry 40775
and 40799
artillery 40840
that 40857
the 40921
winding 40984
of 41143
the 41468
stream 41605
made 41651
his 41786
march 41794
longer 41838
than 42048
he 42071
anticipated 42100
and 42130
that 42230
in 42466
fact 42512
he 42695
only 42763
approached 43000
the 43318
rear 43397
of 43594
Toombs's 43674
position 43817
from 43840
that 43904
direction 44016
about 44042
the 44065
time 44176
when 44394
our 44455
last 44660
and 44675
successful 44753
charge 44944
upon 45115
the 45187
bridge 45291
was 45448
made 45528
between 45698
noon 45800
and 45812
one 46008

The 46281

I 49726
have 49986
already 49999
stated 50290
Crook's 50565
position 50643
was 50737
somewhat 50824
above 51089
the 51430
bridge 51589
but 51772
it 51842
was 51887
thought 51983

to 53230
the 53404
brow 53410

they 55897
could 56056
cover 56071
the 56472
advance 56790
of 57020
Crook 57289
and 57404
that 57922
the 57986
latter 58070
could 58500
make 59236
a 59449
straight 59528
dash 59628

hill 59850

orders 60960
were 61115

under 70176
a 70195
heavy 70338
fire 70687
at 70699
short 70946
range 70979
He 71048
faced 71108
the 71130
enemy 71357
and 71391
returned 71463
the 71601
fire 71603
getting 71717
such 71846
cover 71881
for 71989

to 72563
drive 72653
off 72708
or 72729
silence 72948
his 73019
opponents 73042
The 73097
engagement 73254
was 73330
one 73480
in 73489
which 73532
the 73568
Antietam 73662
prevented 73770
the 74027
combatants 74084
from 74221

quarters 74573

vigorously 75376
continued 75459
with 75467
musketry 75494

Crook 75583
reported 75730
that 75785
his 75909
hands 75922
were 76350
full 76403

that 76978

experiments 79127
in 79422

to 79536
get 79579
over 79681

found 79736
a 79780

place 79947
a 80157
little 80226
way 80366
above 80573

It 152027
was 152077
now 152244
about 152340
one 152542

nearly 153203
three 153242
hours 153559

bloody 154533
contest 154563

successive 155706
efforts 156115
to 156164
carry 156473
the 156679

closely 157691
following 157895
each 157952
other 158033
as 158055
possible 158119
Each 158605
had 158642
been 158973
a 159064
fierce 159341
combat 159361
in 159658
which 159697
the 159940
men 160074
with 160436
wonderful 160482
courage 160492
had 160713
not 160999
easily 161097
accepted 161139
defeat 161591
and 162006
even 162195
when 162352
not 163137
able 163254
to 163404
cross 163846
the 163969
bridge 164033

their 165710

their 166335
well-protected 166383

nearly 166410
concealed 166494
opponents 166507
The 166599
lulls 166608
in 166645
the 166746
fighting 167010
had 167022
been 167037
short 167173
and 167259
only 167298

The 167869
severity 167926

work 168237

for 177222
the 177396

lie 50650
down 53092

But 129634
McClellan's 130697

an 134563
overwhelming 135746
attack 136619

his 139487
right 147606
was 148408
so 149603
strong 150428
that 151912
he 158488
determined 159000
still 165782
to 166908
press 167272
our 172582
advance 178415
and 179248
sent 179500

The 3616

Sturgis's 5125

Crook's 5629

nearly 6306
exhausted 6735
and 7300
it 7720
was 7794
imperative 7998

another 10355

Sturgis 10863

reported 11453
his 11502
men 11513
so 11679
exhausted 12026

was 127666

has 137948
been 141411

that 150702
some 151707
of 151736
them 151795
were 151963
engaged 152294

McClellan's 18169

urge 20808
this 21938
He 22501
answered 22796
the 23030
criticism 23146
by 25438
saying 26002
that 27080
he 32593
did 33217
not 33309
think 33804
it 33931
prudent 33982
to 34993

a 39840

marching 40525
beyond 41193
the 41275
left 42105
flank 45751
of 45787
the 47604
Ninth 47629

occupied 48651
A 49109
P 49442
Hill's 49593
division 49719
that 49840
our 50445
movement 50919
into 51928
Sharpsburg 55492
could 56009
not 62732
have 63036
been 63077
checked 63158
and 70893
assisted 71607
by 72070
the 72423

of 72756
Sumner 72871
and 72901
Franklin 72942
on 73444
the 74841
right 74888
would 75995
apparently 76222
have 77937
made 78150
certain 78869
the 79123
complete 79936
rout 80065
of 80315
Lee 82677
As 85987
troops 89216
are 90146
put 90273
in 90532
reserve 91927
not 92743
to 92786

I 101585
am 102300
convinced 102513
that 102527
McClellan's 103513
refusal 104370
to 104457
use 105603
them 107178
on 107304
the 108039
left 108882
was 108908
the 109772
result 111204
of 111231
his 112084
rooted 112102
belief 112845
through 114540
all 115040
the 115093
day 117412
after 118025
Sedgwick's 122669
defeat 125968
that 126730
Lee 127223
was 128954
overwhelmingly 129131
superior 131075
in 131431
force 132120
and 133535
was 133606
preparing 134301
to 134517
return 134893
a 135694
crushing 135732
blow 136402

a 143668
gap 147782

cover 148953
a 150611
retreat 153558

that 157820
wing 159056
should 163061
be 163271
driven 163695
back 164879
Except 165202
in 166896
this 167266
way 167613
also 167662
I 167829
am 167889
at 168207
a 168409
loss 171905
to 172166
account 173518
for 173697
the 176205
inaction 176647

to 81784
have 83175
our 83542

he 107943
regarded 108953
action 111374
there 111674
as 111741
hopeless 114856
and 115184
looked 115836
upon 116973
our 118362

as 121269
a 121607
sort 125903
of 127201
forlorn 127592
hope 127764
to 128543

Lee 131343
from 131829

will 167175
be 167408
remembered 168905
that 170681
Franklin's 170706

after 171546
forcing 171615
Crampton's 171669

be 41320
sent 55918
to 60643
occupy 67070

Franklin 37975

Slocum's 61288

up 185309

the 59389
other 62285

the 147263
country 147282
as 147301
we 147773
swung 147883
forward 148642
would 153409
have 155492
developed 155822
Hill's 156816
presence 157595
and 158098
enabled 166116
the 177044
commanding 182403

either 1695
to 81066
stop 2629
our 147678

its 174354

being 742
engaged 3317

It 12148
would 12214
have 12599
been 12610
invaluable 16515
to 18866
Hooker 22638
in 30589
the 31653
morning 50960
as 51152
it 51317
would 61883
have 62001
been 62066
to 62157
us 67881
in 69474
the 70597
afternoon 75095
McClellan 76588
had 77309
marched 82164
from 110261
Frederick 116853
City 121285
with 123875
the 128128
information 140649
that 140861
Lee's 140896
army 149838
was 150244
divided 155059
Jackson 155468
being 158570
detached 158739
with 162343
a 163805
large 166963
force 167028
to 171627
take 172068
Harper's 172821
Ferry 172891
He 176641
had 184912
put 809
Lee's 9867
strength 9617
at 10763
men 16572
Assuming 25035
that 32781
there 51278
was 58461
still 62104
danger 62886
that 86893
Jackson 131514
might 134786
come 136491
upon 148590
our 158015
left 158455
with 171239
his 176025
large 87713
force 88218
and 471
that 2994
Lee 22342
had 51398
proven 62098
strong 69028
enough 106395
without 107942
Jackson 110490
to 112226
repulse 112342
three 113551
corps 113615
on 114411
our 114429
right 117914
and 135432
right 135687
centre 144793
McClellan 158396
might 163389
have 183793
regarded 69392
his 69498
own 81282
army 97430
as 103471
divided 112189
also 135358
for 145272
the 172816
purpose 22451
of 76459
meeting 185325
both 147313
opponents 16155
and 87399
his 128267
cavalry 146270
would 163537
have 164722
been 251
upon 2469
the 3099
flank 5372
of 6267
the 6573
part 6653
with 8429
which 9037
he 10148
was 12412
attacking 13107
Lee 13798
Porter 15472
would 16528
have 17976
been 18056
in 22098
position 22670
to 26155
help 26227
either 29203
part 29790
in 30960
an 31670
extremity 31703
or 31874
to 32156
cover 37522
a 38303
retreat 38598
and 39628
Burnside 40488
would 40609
have 41495
been 41607
the 42166
only 42711
subordinate 44044
available 44178
to 44246
check 45480
Lee's 46313
apparent 47616
success 48259
Will 50986
any 51217
other 51621
hypothesis 51793
intelligibly 52623
account 53282
for 53661
McClellan's 53668
dispositions 56123
and 57096
orders 58003
The 58342
error 58435
in 60513
the 60563
above 60752
assumption 60962
would 61219
be 61497
that 61902
McClellan 62156
estimated 62237
Lee's 62309
troops 62490
at 64118
nearly 64134
double 64767
their 65856
actual 66564
numbers 66850
and 67561
that 69254
what 69272
was 70158
taken 70582
for 71050
proof 71175
of 71745
Lee's 72294
superiority 73712
in 75618
force 76052
on 76299
the 77383
field 77622
was 78406
a 80262
series 80269
of 81250
partial 83097
reverses 84300
which 85446
resulted 86480
directly 87861
from 88091
the 88581
piecemeal 90299
and 91003
disjointed 91099
way 91532
in 91686
which 92542
McClellan's 92866
morning 92973
attacks 94186
had 95926
been 96174
made 96463
The 97311
same 97778
explanation 98782
is 99349
the 99663
most 100428
satisfactory 101025
one 103799
that 103852
I 105473
can 106798
give 108257
for 109009
the 110014
inaction 111921
of 112222
Thursday 112231
the 114048
18th 114193
of 114365
September 115251
Could 115565
McClellan 116192
have 117958
known 118108
the 118354
desperate 119284
condition 119410
of 122355
most 123317
of 125103
Lee's 125681
brigades 126203
he 126330
would 127484
also 127917
have 129699
known 129859
that 130325
his 134718
own 135161
were 135737
in 135775
much 135939
better 136069
case 136542
badly 137237
as 137431

I 138294
do 138422
not 138591
doubt 139430
that 140385
most 141386
of 141846
his 142694
subordinates 143199
discouraged 145437
the 146471
resumption 146501
of 147408
the 147784
attack 148726
for 153053
the 153216
belief 155912
in 157449
Lee's 157458
great 157826
preponderance 159948
in 163818
numbers 164133
had 165461
been 166805
chronic 166871
in 168183
the 168239
army 169218
during 169605
the 171275
whole 172717
year 173324
That 174100
belief 174807
was 174825
based 174930
upon 175166
the 175365
inconceivably 175866
mistaken 176939
reports 176965
of 178177
the 179047
secret-service 179721
organization 179875
accepted 181684
at 182800
headquarters 183308
given 183350
to 183641
the 183734
War 183740
Department 183798
at 184049
Washington 184100
as 184237
a 184247
reason 184297
for 185293
incessant 321
demands 4110
of 7440
reinforcements 7861
and 8519
permeating 8734
downward 9821
through 11989
the 12144
whole 13051
organization 13564
till 13877
the 14712
error 15249
was 16535
accepted 24919
as 26250
truth 27486
by 33319
officers 34159
and 39289
men 43453
and 48786
became 51130
a 51839
factor 55208
in 57909
their 57919
morale 58165
which 59265
can 60503
hardly 62898
be 62915
overestimated 63162
The 63678
result 65678
was 66458
that 70211
Lee 70460
retreated 77729
unmolested 79173
on 81457
the 84759
night 85141
of 89388
the 91238
18th 92366

been 112513
a 114068
real 115730

success 121026
was 126242
a 127404

which 138767
our 140133

we 80566
parted 80652
in 80705
the 80888
Ohio 80970
Senate 81203
in 81345
April 81721

the 82343
preceding 83077

When 92205
McClellan 92266
directed 92321
us 92402
to 92422
leave 92536
the 92740
ridge 92987
because 92990
the 93602
display 94048

attracted 94921
the 95281
enemy's 95456
fire 95472
Colonel 95534
Key 95554
took 95624
my 95773
arm 96019
and 96068
we 96283
walked 96299
a 96317
little 96368
way 96381
down 96479
the 96486
slope 96546
till 96599
we 96700
found 96711
a 96916
fallen 97486
tree 97488
on 97693
which 97767
we 97790
sat 97877
down 98014
whilst 98099
he 98107
plunged 98142
eagerly 98254
into 98695
the 99478
history 99577
of 99774
his 100123
own 100327
opinions 100589
since 100742
we 100866
had 100983
discussed 101329
the 101629
causes 101927
of 101968
the 102238
war 102288
in 102303
the 102343
legislature 102829
of 102837
our 102898
State 103131
He 103145
told 103274
me 103298
with 103790
earnestness 103811
that 104341
he 104380
had 105313
greatly 105352
modified 105902
his 106598
views 107619
on 107871
the 108256
subject 108611
of 109725
slavery 110365
and 110901
he 111125
was 111329
now 111642
satisfied 111834
that 111917
the 111947
war 111999
must 112040
end 112087
in 112149
its 112153
abolition 112427
The 112446
system 112660
was 112763
so 112995
plainly 113410
the 113903
soul 114750
of 114783
the 114850
rebellion 115086
and 115649
the 115663
tie 115832
which 116334
bound 116353
the 116788
seceded 117189
States 117247
together 117256
that 117540
its 117729
existence 117820
must 117866
necessarily 117873
depend 117934
upon 117954
the 117970
success 118068
of 118116
the 118162
revolutionary 118260
movement 118280
and 118598
it 118885
would 119043
be 119121
a 120693
fair 120853
object 121112
of 121535
attack 121544
if 121745
doing 122100
so 122507
would 123635
help 124396
our 124464
cause 125396
I 125531
was 126522
struck 127232
by 128815
the 128887
zeal 131203
with 131709
which 132838
he 134975
dashed 135069
into 135116
the 135131
discussion 135144
forgetful 135266
of 135269
his 135297
actual 137395
surroundings 137846
in 137874
his 138016
wish 138133
to 138193
make 138626
me 138728
quickly 138777
understand 139001
the 140498
change 140777
that 141869
had 142112
come 142415
over 142462
his 146622
views 146725
since 146736
we 146972
parted 147527
at 147623
Columbus 148548
He 150037
was 151767
so 151779
absorbed 151828
that 151841
even 151858
when 151872
a 151888
shell 151926
burst 152078
near 152087
us 154133
he 154144
only 155280
half 157154
gave 157208
it 157333
attention 158045
saying 158336
in 158506
a 159717
parenthetical 159738
way 160242
that 160817
he 162199
would 162813
change 164904
his 164933
position 166804
as 166834
he 168035
would 168926
rather 171007
not 175703
be 177081
hit 181999
in 182013
the 185270
back 185408
by 185446
one 185454
of 8967
those 32358
confounded 40687
things 62825
We 64903
had 79171
been 89582
so 89719
sitting 100935
that 102271
in 102749
facing 131419
me 131558
his 160458
back 5028
was 10732
toward 14210
the 41104
front 43291
and 46341
the 46454
line 51063
of 62740
fire 73427
Colonel 74858
Key 79620
has 120933
been 788
regarded 2998
by 3435
many 3949
as 3999
McClellan's 5901
evil 6080
genius 6296
whose 6300
influence 6454
had 8382
been 8648
dominant 8969
in 9018
the 9846
general's 10584
political 10819
conduct 10983
and 11022
who 11095
was 11921
therefore 12082
the 12420
cause 12757
of 13288
his 13400
downfall 13451
His 14753
influence 14792
on 14838
McClellan 15191
was 15316
unquestionably 15808
great 17056
--and 17116
what 17793
he 18001
said 19562
to 20028
me 20626
is 21359
an 21568
important 22652
help 23111
in 23526
understanding 24071
the 24249
general's 24859
conduct 25172
and 25499
opinions 25660

accords 26342
with 27644
other 28340
statements 29987
of 30859

Judge 48909
Dickson 50609
which 50901
he 51142
showed 51944
to 52112
me 52181
reiterating 53860
his 53872
statements 53949
in 54315
it 54635
General 56005
McClellan 57203
urged 58564
me 58590
to 58983
come 59524
to 60292
his 61457
headquarters 61791
without 62114
ceremony 62495
and 62759
after 64161
the 64700
battle 65022
of 65311
Antietam 66749
I 66807
had 67326
several 72493
opportunities 72533
of 72562
unrestrained 72988
discussion 73946
of 74643
affairs 75003
in 76200
which 77327
he 77542
seemed 79884
entirely 80849
frank 81245
in 82166
giving 82485
me 82959
his 86498
opinions 89803
It 91713
was 91964
plainly 92169
evident 92528
that 92803
he 93783
was 94600
subjected 97102
to 97637
a 99666
good 99718
deal 100779
of 101231
pressure 102066
by 102867
opponents 103329
of 104709
the 105955
administration 106226
to 107829
make 108752
him 109926
commit 110402
himself 114894
to 117104
them 119699
On 120836
the 120978
other 121082
hand 121790
Governor 122296
Dennison 123905
of 124580
Ohio 125386
who 125630
was 126575
his 126787
sincere 130729
friend 131561
took 131789
every 133182
opportunity 133203
to 134670
counteract 135061
such 135806
influences 136330
and 136617
to 137580
promote 137669
a 141898
good 144418
understanding 147027
between 147422
him 147486
and 148596
Mr 149042
Lincoln 149120
McClellan 149257
perfectly 149907
knew 150157
my 150176
own 150361
position 152487
as 152653
an 154426
outspoken 154457
Republican 154797
who 156274
from 157731
the 157992
first 158054
had 158872
regarded 160466
the 163393
system 165935
of 166658
slavery 167077
as 167721
the 170351
stake 172053
ventured 173781
by 174979
the 175364
Secessionists 175450
on 176350
their 176456
success 178083
in 178301
the 178338
war 178365
and 179430
who 179765
held 179910
to 180680
John 180783
Quincy 181443
Adams's 185079
doctrine 5377
that 23905
the 42913
war 53495
powers 153859
were 2821
adequate 152855
to 71763
destroy 75118
the 140679
institution 3793
which 7489
we 57075
could 64863
not 74908
constitutionally 87265
abolish 119922
otherwise 148732
With 105563
me 9210
the 88298
only 185109
question 10825
was 79941
when 47372
the 97914
ripe 166328
time 97198
had 75841
come 71176
for 4746
action 101103
and 136866
I 133529
had 157964
looked 121884
forward 24566
to 113605
Mr 75267
Lincoln's 106008
proclamation 88284
with 12922
some 24052
impatience 24774
at 30450
the 32371
delay 33301
The 34089
total 35454
impression 48867
left 49648
upon 51374
me 29728
by 30356
the 30427
general's 30650
conversation 31104
was 34742
that 34977
he 35262
agreed 35585
with 43699
Colonel 47469
Key 75131
in 90545
believing 141147
that 172100
the 174872
war 177658
ought 5039
to 121982
end 132731
in 162736
abolition 162766
of 65690
slavery 7228
but 65189
he 3991
feared 41796
the 46491
effects 60479
of 60920
haste 61919
and 63603
thought 126248
the 154660
steps 157617
toward 183274
the 183327
end 185261
should 79742
be 132445
conservatively 53792
careful 119447
and 127387
not 157063
brusquely 113958
radical 117217
I 129908
thought 822
and 4368
still 8070
think 9198
that 9880
he 11303
regarded 11779
the 15081
President 15188
as 15433
nearly 15482
right 18369
in 18402
his 18477
general 20190
views 20621
and 23362
political 23692
purposes 24622
but 24869
overcrowded 25496
by 25713
more 27336
radical 28823
men 29235
around 29283
him 30243
into 30253
steps 31612
which 34285
as 34612
yet 34678
were 36253
imprudent 36782
and 37316
extreme 37781
Such 37938
an 38008
attitude 38068
on 38254
his 39335
part 39949
made 40727
Governor 42325
Dennison 43071
and 43281
myself 43366
feel 44799
that 44894
there 45641
was 46189
no 46330
need 46591
of 46669
any 47192
political 47209
quarrel 47996
between 48492
him 48675
and 48809
the 49044
administration 49083
and 49168
that 49354
if 50181
he 50295
would 54677
only 58583
rebuff 62291
all 62979
political 64463
intriguers 64796
and 66869
put 67318
more 67596
aggressive 67971
energy 68309
into 72185
his 73050
military 75277
operations 77103
his 77168
career 77496
might 78093
be 78670
a 78941
success 79861
for 80148
the 81075
country 81234
as 81799
well 82075
as 84122
for 84329
himself 85818
The 87691
portions 89774
of 90680
his 91581
correspondence 91609
with 92400
Burnside 93205
which 95190
have 95264
become 95298
public 96669
show 97503
that 99142
the 99989
latter 100865
also 101567
had 102127
as 102752
a 103547
true 105845
friend 105882
constantly 106450
urged 107475
him 107745
to 107874
keep 107924
out 108484
of 110035
political 110580
controversy 110639
Burnside 111896
himself 112329
like 114257
Grant 114886
and 114999
Sherman 115013
began 115425
with 115462
a 115773
dislike 115895
of 116016
the 117436
antislavery 118650
movement 118681
but 119154
also 122537
like 122699
them 125259
his 125973
patriotism 126013
being 127828
the 131978
dominant 132081
quality 132692
the 133679
natural 135216
effect 135933
of 136776
fighting 138286
the 139972
Secessionists 140993
was 141417
to 142015
beget 146500
in 147956
him 148122
a 148746
hearty 150071
acceptance 150166
of 151081
the 152606
policy 155781
of 156583
emancipation 158162
to 158462
which 159026
Mr 163513
Lincoln 163633
had 163688
been 164270
led 165788
by 165941
the 168808
same 169287
educational 170781
process 171398
At 172302
the 172422
time 172558
I 173257
am 174395
speaking 174605
of 174841
I 175557
knew 176893
nothing 177661
of 179024
McClellan's 179524
famous 179621
letter 180380
to 180482
the 181466
President 75681
from 21631
Harrison's 123532
Landing 132344
of 75686
July 30500
but 87218
since 124839
it 7571
has 46285
come 57904
to 148022
light 148187
I 119598
have 84714
interpreted 118565
it 115091
much 169870
less 157346
harshly 170322
than 27614
many 143896
have 146175
done 148340
Reading 163315
it 48306
in 48629
the 53413
light 74984
of 80112
his 91691
talk 97274
during 113275
those 165985
Antietam 68594
days 72451
I 109909
think 3722
it 81362
fair 152251
to 155358
regard 155407
it 155825
as 20711
an 43095
effort 80098
to 176796
show 24974
Mr 35199
Lincoln 90288
that 94926
they 162381
were 168521
not 43262
far 157869
apart 155151
in 155102
opinion 20320
and 43063
to 95103
influence 168447
the 142853
President 21681
to 68858
take 132986
the 166354
more 44483
conservative 86594
course 4049
to 65111
which 72615
he 100110
thought 112657
him 115818
inclined 117807
when 35778
taking 183898
counsel 23484
only 88412
of 176
his 249
own 278
judgment 2561
McClellan 2946
knew 3720
that 4060
his 4640
change 5206
of 5368
base 5458
to 6521
the 6856
James 6861
River 7305
in 7361
June 7655
was 7773
not 7884
accepted 8055
as 8845
the 10065
successful 10258
strategy 11392
he 11562
declared 12333
it 12362
to 12834
be 13092
and 14309
that 15019
strong 15344
influences 15551
were 15710
at 16739
work 18140
to 19113
remove 19937
him 20023
Under 21944
the 23171
guise 24231
of 26196
giving 26568
advice 26960
to 27467
the 27511
President 30594
he 31027
was 31977
in 32427
fact 33300
assuring 33314
him 33584
that 34491
he 35685
did 37187
not 38485
look 39114
to 39771
the 40508
acknowledgment 40622
of 40785
the 40917
Confederacy 41120
as 41589
a 42435
conceivable 42534
outcome 43037
of 43765
the 43772
war 43970
that 44256
the 44270
contraband 44286
doctrine 44864
applied 45201
to 45272
slaves 48396
was 48560
consistent 50729
with 51148
compensated 52023
emancipation 52427
that 52434
he 52822
favored 52991
the 53963
application 54342
of 54574
the 56277
principle 58339
to 58391
the 58562
border 58634
States 60085
so 62654
as 63473
to 66989
make 67183
them 68866
free 69104
States 69114
that 69998
concentration 74265
of 74447
military 74773
force 75099
as 75418
opposed 75441
to 77988
dispersion 78568
of 78781
effort 78935
was 79472
the 82333
true 82425
policy 83085
that 83947
he 84055
opposed 84240
the 84515
rules 85194
of 85614
warfare 86241
which 86264
he 86284
assumed 86321
were 86536
announced 87413
in 87688
General 89268
Pope's 90674
much 91546
criticised 93033
orders 93491
and 93641
lastly 98537
that 99797
he 101492
would 102019
cordially 102372
serve 102498
under 103947
such 104150
general-in-chief 104565
as 105864
Mr 107223
Lincoln 107272
should 107624
select 107906
Compare 108205
all 108331
this 108612
with 108660
Mr 109233
Lincoln's 110183
known 111606
views 112285
It 113191
was 113375
notorious 113522
that 114775
he 116639
was 116789
thought 118290
to 118460
be 119028
too 119443
conservative 119856
by 120028
many 120402
of 121011
his 121886
own 122633
party 124614
He 124786
had 125052
urged 126251
a 126536
system 127392
of 128559
compensated 128659
emancipation 128705
for 129541
the 129915
border 130821
States 130885
He 133157
had 133910
said 134100
that 134592
he 135947
held 137544
the 137695
slavery 137701
question 140228
to 140292
be 140477
only 141297
a 141549
part 142465
and 142937
an 144700
absolutely 145341
subordinate 146243
part 146712
of 147910
the 148908
greater 148985
question 150133
of 150369
saving 150466
the 150483
Union 150575
He 150996
had 151099
disapproved 152342
of 153413
a 154882
portion 154921
of 156136
Pope's 156837
order 160105
regarding 163294
the 163341
treatment 165216
of 170676
non-combatants 172484
However 172522
ill-advised 175227
McClellan's 175334
letter 179031
was 179822
it 180467
may 181958
be 182177
read 182402
between 811
the 9869
lines 16327
as 90662
an 183901
attempt 184159
to 184289
strengthen 184659
himself 7178
with 54472
the 182614
President 183081
as 6649
against 6700
Stanton 15931
and 15935
others 15940
and 16493
to 16634
make 16840
his 17368
military 17375
seat 17494
firmer 17589
in 17750
the 18257
saddle 18509
by 18987
showing 19048
that 19102
he 19920
was 19985
not 20859
in 22177
political 22196
antagonism 22859
to 23242
Mr 24725
Lincoln 24970
but 25304
held 26487
in 26615
substance 26787
the 28381
conservative 28464
views 31414
that 31421
were 31424
supposed 31953
to 32740
be 33182
his 33706
Its 33827
purpose 34040
seems 34313
to 34393
me 34945
to 35015
have 35045
been 35160
of 35166
this 35561
personal 35691
sort 36697
He 36849
did 37363
not 37541
publish 37692
it 38293
at 39749
the 40125
time 40952
and 43743
it 43864
was 43923
not 44000
till 44116
he 46135
was 46144
removed 47728
from 49378
his 49703
command 49852
that 50576
it 50656
became 50841
a 59749
kind 59811
of 60531
political 61819
manifesto 62144
This 63914
view 64352
is 64431
supported 65886
by 66028
what 66119
occurred 66594
after 66986
the 67150
publication 67752
of 67955
the 67988
Emancipation 68138
Proclamation 68374
which 69179
I 69302
shall 69662
tell 70714
presently 71404
but 71532
to 71587
preserve 71622
the 71814
proper 71851
sequence 71921
I 72111
must 72231
first 72356
give 72581
another 73506
incident 74403
A 74872
few 75410
days 75429
after 75464
the 75548
battle 75586
of 75602
Antietam 75892
a 75895
prominent 75981
clergyman 76393
of 76811
Hagerstown 76938
spent 77091
the 77699
Sunday 78047
in 78215
camp 78487
and 78523
McClellan 78761
invited 79010
a 79291
number 79307
of 79729
officers 80077
to 80301
attend 80360
religious 80622
services 80630
in 80635
the 80764
parlors 80871
of 82215
the 82289
house 82504
where 83158
headquarters 83163
were 83296
The 83334
rooms 85364
were 85515
well 85879
filled 85886
several 86029
civilians 86038
being 86201
also 86474
present 86574
I 86619
was 86624
standing 86936
by 86985
myself 86992
as 87027
we 87165
were 87614
waiting 87776
for 87971
the 87977
clergyman 88034
to 88732
appear 88737
when 89312
a 89570
stout 90088
man 92481
in 92494
civilian's 92858
dress 93627
entered 93658
into 95517
conversation 96579
with 96640
me 97238
He 97542
stood 97715
at 99393
my 100203
side 100312
as 102632
we 103025
faced 103160
the 103604
upper 103631
part 103655
of 104122
the 104251
suite 104349
of 104402
rooms 105010
and 105362
taking 105420
it 105486
to 105745
be 105963
a 106085
casual 106232
talk 106262
merely 106296
to 106590
pass 106783
the 106953
time 106969
I 107014
paid 107056
rather 107205
languid 107396
attention 107499
to 107629
it 107979
and 108097
to 108440
him 108534
as 108570
he 108593
began 108652
with 108929
some 109148
complimentary 109173
remarks 109211
about 109346
the 109606
army 109660
and 109732
its 109768
recent 109833
work 109921
He 110234
spoke 110668
quite 110781
enthusiastically 110867
of 111034
McClellan 111134
and 111195
my 111604
loyalty 111701
to 112316
my 112592
commander 112814
as 112820
well 113213
as 113319
my 113639
personal 114009
attachment 114184
to 114583
him 115137
made 115699
me 116549
assent 116803
cordially 116836
to 118663
what 118695
he 118704
said 118709
He 118720
then 118766
spoke 118802
of 121384
the 122067
politicians 123040
in 124938
Washington 125116
as 125342
wickedly 125678
trying 126381
to 126686
sacrifice 126858
the 126928
general 127151
and 127537
added 127549
whispering 127639
the 127682
words 128041
emphatically 128072
in 128152
my 128721
ear 128930
But 129090
you 129651
military 130239
men 130348
have 131328
that 131471
matter 133389
in 133570
your 134553
own 134678
hands 135388
you 135446
have 135670
but 136274
to 136633
tell 136890
the 137899
administration 138319
what 138462
they 138509
must 138561
do 138615
and 138925
they 138948
will 139098
not 139707
dare 140856
to 141086
disregard 141235
it 141289
This 141484
roused 141603
me 142596
and 142638
I 142765
turned 143107
upon 143233
him 145211
with 145609
a 146160
sharp 147643
What 148242
do 148530
you 149670
mean 152442
sir 152460
As 152584
I 152599
faced 154547
him 156413
I 156417
saw 157752
at 157929
once 157989
by 158437
his 158442
look 158530
that 158583
he 158660
had 158784
mistaken 158850
me 158956
for 159009
another 159268
he 159309
mumbled 159391
something 159434
about 159549
having 159748
taken 159880
me 160408
for 160564
an 160648
acquaintance 160660
of 160897
his 161841
and 161910
moved 162087
away 162095
among 162113
the 162118
company 162317
I 162551
was 162583
a 162661
good 162726
deal 162963
agitated 164594
for 165129
though 165258
there 165495
was 165530
more 165539
or 166278
less 166955
of 167807
current 167936
talk 168674
about 168815
disloyal 168837
influences 168840
at 169119
work 170276
I 170761
had 171036
been 171171
sceptical 171491
as 171613
to 171884
the 172124
fact 172666
and 172724
to 172940
be 173185
brought 173280
face 173363
to 173564
face 173630
with 173912
that 174233
sort 174236
of 174304
thing 174673
was 174972
a 175031
surprise 175190
I 175195
was 175298
a 175766
stranger 176361
to 176546
most 176824
of 176860
those 177559
who 177817
were 177843
there 177926
and 178670
walked 178731
a 179478
little 179599
aside 179671
watching 179831
the 179883
man 180302
who 180574
had 180801
left 180916
me 181366
I 181516
soon 69122
saw 95403
him 116425
talking 118103
with 166616
General 42947
Fitz-John 97025
Porter 82743
on 114213
the 3988
opposite 13203
side 66301
of 158905
the 65913
room 71964
evidently 72236
calling 1415
attention 65721
to 10442
me 69455
as 89802
if 184884
asking 185032
who 3489
I 580
was 54018
I 91389
made 185279
inquiries 11718
as 32420
to 67656
who 67661
the 120318
civilian 122802
was 140968
and 143575
later 143592
came 149479
to 150102
know 182005
him 182917
by 182960
sight 183928
very 183989
well 184068
He 184417
was 27924
John 140205
W 3591
Garrett 5061
President 21593
of 52299
the 133217
Baltimore 139765
and 124070
Ohio 52001
Railroad 122964
Company 128777
Mr 24050
Lincoln's 10299
Emancipation 77513
Proclamation 80245
was 8148
published 27531
on 59161
the 83617
24th 128163
of 121883
September 107904
and 21160
within 27052
a 43564
very 45679
few 78716
days 178273
I 180332
was 24094
invited 26120
to 35146
meet 78952
General 132778
Burnside 177236
and 5733
General 6518
John 6604
Cochrane 6686
of 8447
New 17691
York 55007
at 129532
a 142701
camp 152566
dinner 160910
in 161218
McClellan's 164972
tent 169907
General 185402
Cochrane 22285
was 28161
a 142680
War 150615
Democrat 150936
in 152550
politics 185159
and 63898
had 10113
been 12880
active 12911
as 14239
a 14503
politician 51836
in 51879
his 51956
State 52343
He 59978
was 96771
also 114442
the 122666
son-in-law 122791
of 130480
Gerrit 51736
Smith 52085
the 7409
well-known 56952
abolitionist 7252
and 182967
had 183030
advocated 183067
arming 183674
the 183813
slaves 183838
as 183916
early 184060
as 184280
November 184540
McClellan 183521
told 183543
us 183572
frankly 42730
that 17808
he 39875
had 66377
brought 95064
us 95721
there 97765
for 100333
the 104068
purpose 105091
of 106335
asking 109006
our 114214
opinions 146734
and 169220
advice 101108
with 14132
regard 34049
to 42159
the 86687
course 65149
he 32201
should 113952
pursue 10447
respecting 156555
the 119183
Proclamation 4736
He 89776
said 36218
that 120245
he 45529
was 169402
urged 94482
to 94536
put 164274
himself 165307
in 171999
open 172012
opposition 213
to 1615
it 1622
by 7393
politicians 7416
not 7986
only 9970
but 9975
by 16485
army 18289
officers 18752
who 19036
were 19602
near 20500
to 21132
him 21864
He 22421
named 22684
no 22909
names 25155
but 26468
intimated 26720
that 27309
they 27672
were 27758
of 27916
rank 28303
and 28798
influence 30598
which 30782
gave 31538
weight 32824
to 33008
their 33587
advice 35356
He 35446
knew 36088
that 37112
we 37193
were 37572
all 42283
friends 42819
of 42966
the 43064
administration 44220
and 45488
his 45755
object 48246
seemed 48357
to 48397
be 50338
to 51042
learn 53097
whether 53152
we 53232
thought 53388
he 53503
should 53519
say 54996
anything 55145
or 56073
should 57498
maintain 57761
silence 59069
on 59238
the 59451
subject 60318
for 60834
he 60839
assumed 61443
that 61750
we 63019
would 64036
oppose 64593
any 64813
hostile 65335
demonstration 65401
on 70442
his 71284
part 71290
This 72063
naturally 74078
led 74129
to 74152
inquiries 74893
as 75732
to 75807
his 77989
actual 79029
attitude 79802
to 80441
the 80547
slavery 80986
question 80993
and 81207
he 81353
expressed 82028
himself 82585
in 82996
substance 83042
as 84066
I 89519
have 89688
before 92715
indicated 94198
repeating 95444
with 96020
even 96361
stronger 96434
emphasis 96609
his 96668
belief 97647
that 98387
the 98696
war 99097
would 99318
work 99747
out 99863
the 103173
manumission 104225
of 105759
the 106000
slaves 106619
gradually 107096
and 108960
ultimately 109737
and 110079
that 110107
as 110292
to 110379
those 110417
who 111004
came 111042
within 111333
our 112517
lines 114408
as 114567
we 114820
advanced 116786
the 117874
liberation 118313
would 118329
be 119619
complete 120055
and 120060
immediate 120298
He 120798
thought 120905
however 120946
that 121056
the 121337
Proclamation 122413
was 123071
premature 127877
and 128253
that 128563
it 129018
indicated 129946
a 130038
change 130103
in 131854
the 131955
President's 132653
attitude 133545
which 133619
he 133869
attributed 133939
to 134287
radical 134593
influences 134902
at 137484
Washington 137909
There 140631
had 143140
been 143223
no 145487
previous 146064
understanding 147385
between 148347
us 152993
who 154420
were 157861
his 160053
guests 160363
For 161575
my 162790
part 162811
I 162913
then 164931
met 165579
General 165971
Cochrane 166064
for 166762
the 169014
first 171790
time 172005
and 172258
had 172274
conversed 173635
with 173996
McClellan 174267
himself 174545
more 175044
freely 176195
on 177652
political 179040
subjects 181235
than 182653
I 182853
had 183635
with 183661
Burnside 99296
We 156023
found 156029
ourselves 118947
however 119159
in 79574
entire 118401
accord 131895
in 59444
advising 51151
him 51606
that 172501
any 182144
declaration 185198
on 185401
his 44309
part 116375
against 129356
the 130743
Proclamation 165557
would 185116
be 78651
a 103059
fatal 4636
error 11062
We 24279
could 24569
easily 30516
understand 32367
that 32442
he 32816
should 35771
differ 40497
from 43778
us 44023
in 45732
his 47565
way 47800
of 48766
viewing 55290
the 71728
question 73356
of 74481
public 76203
policy 82699
but 138447
we 141633
pointed 141876
out 144261
very 156048
clearly 168270
that 2673
any 147722
public 15130
utterance 79870
by 82813
him 95320
in 163576
his 163604
official 30695
character 83698
criticising 140774
the 141611
civil 141695
policy 8629
of 58602
the 141051
administration 141379
would 429
be 4044
properly 4055
regarded 23502
as 26388
a 34756
usurpation 40451
He 67402
intimated 105220
that 107707
this 115372
was 116520
his 116840
own 135153
opinion 137443
but 138271
by 119307
way 526
of 2446
showing 8280
how 50048
the 56807
matter 57217
was 64624
thrust 69150
at 74593
him 85954
by 93517
others 132150
said 140362
that 140538
people 155632
had 157459
assured 157827
him 166132
that 173385
the 179148
army 3823
was 3962
so 4380
devoted 4396
to 4421
him 4513
that 5171
they 7137
would 8659
as 12119
one 17608
man 23189
enforce 24248
any 24583
decision 25364
he 25427
should 25679
make 26163
as 26271
to 36636
any 40329
part 40564
of 48841
the 48990
war 51681
policy 52063
I 52133
had 54348
so 66911
recently 70395
gone 71241
through 82645
the 91259
little 91906
experience 120029
on 122524
this 122734
subject 136612
which 138285
I 140749
have 142938
narrated 145161
above 153100
that 153811
I 155459
here 164169
spoke 165801
out 165833
with 166429
some 166461
emphasis 184298
I 3499
said 18010
that 18476
those 20442
who 24448
made 29778
such 29781
assurances 34023
were 37169
his 37175
worst 41046
enemies 55776
and 68254
in 78563
my 79082
judgment 79174
knew 84887
much 99141
less 99453
of 103844
the 109329
army 109652
than 109815
they 115936
pretended 120314
that 132024
our 132849
volunteer 132881
soldiers 150721
were 151827
citizens 151999
as 163719
well 174840
as 18435
soldiers 74302
and 101374
were 3401
citizens 3667
more 66127
than 93204
soldiers 98733
and 113991
that 114473
greatly 134955
as 144919
I 181148
knew 90792
them 4149
to 4518
be 8350
attached 10518
to 10784
him 15412
I 17329
believed 17878
not 20699
a 20843
corporal's 23746
guard 25608
would 26472
stand 29500
by 31636
his 33505
side 33547
if 36525
he 42446
were 43389
to 45823
depart 46533
from 49078
the 53440
strict 59066
subordination 59376
of 61676
the 69046
military 69355
to 77567
the 77616
civil 78344
authority 78619
Burnside 81771
and 82320
Cochrane 82772
both 83251
emphatically 84782
assented 88902
to 91712
this 92509
and 92914
McClellan 93714
added 95263
that 98330
he 102221
heartily 103729
believed 106469
both 111210
that 115262
it 115416
was 122565
true 122767
and 130527
that 130767
it 132393
ought 132408
to 132929
be 135596
so 141726
But 142681
this 143375
still 143551
left 144100
the 144227
question 144269
open 144468
whether 149049
the 156160
very 164093
fact 167556
that 167653
there 168728
was 173427
an 176755
agitation 1941
in 18085
camp 18347
on 18401
the 29560
subject 49353
and 51245
intrigues 69879
of 70964
the 71169
sort 71192
I 71210
have 72327
mentioned 74279
did 75016
not 92733
make 93160
it 99763
wise 99900
for 104894
him 163145
to 879
say 16239
something 9287
which 9830
would 17792
show 18368
at 19406
least 20089
that 33764
he 38099
gave 40480
no 47995
countenance 49403
to 52016
any 79133
would-be 79606
revolutionists 82903
We 101225
debated 105257
this 105654
at 109185
some 109466
length 113513
with 114885
the 133029
general 137989
conclusion 180199
that 40060
it 7750
might 1577
be 10699
well 20249
for 53458
him 80405
to 80454
remind 80948
the 87693
army 87771
in 100112
general 109589
orders 113039
that 115970
whatever 146978
might 1721
be 88610
their 141544
rights 29972
as 9969
citizens 95118
they 1000
must 5207
as 19402
soldiers 36153
beware 148200
of 169201
any 66762
organized 8397
effort 54022
to 19287
meddle 34284
with 75073
the 30966
functions 38794
of 87230
the 125951

I 74034
regarded 141630
it 2520

an 144681
honest 92085
effort 116582
on 8343
his 3731

to 14943
break 84010
through 134135
the 134901

which 144041
intriguers 147627
had 148759
spread 169035
for 183865
him 44135

regretted 183486
that 53816
what 134890
seemed 137475

me 137485
one 149172

trying 117573
to 80340
find 24054
how 24252
nearly 26116
we 35510
could 37396
come 43238
together 47510
the 88716
general 99620
may 117541
have 68229
put 9189
his 7603
opinions 21253
with 24046
a 130694
liberality 30855
which 64830
outran 14407
his 23771
ordinary 31147
statements 45402
of 75333
belief 130447
but 135785
I 175564
am 13410
very 60250
sure 14190
that 26382
he 92332
gave 92387
every 126028
evidence 158425
of 168310
sincerity 178768
and 118408
that 34221
none 105576
of 138909
us 143254
entertained 173812
a 28735
doubt 30419
of 31008
his 67028
being 67058
entirely 100001
transparent 142716
with 171564
us 99336
He 6311
has 20379
since 110903
in 42327
his 105223
Own 90849
Story 146024
referred 75960
to 141425
his 182203

the 35965

evidence 10498
that 24024
General 30371

McClellan's 23032
letters 28720
show 29495
that 33607
his 35035
first 35140
impulse 37159
was 38235
to 39903
antagonism 44062
but 45290
there 46423
is 46629
no 46680
fair 46846
reason 46992
to 47135
doubt 47981
that 48735
his 49348
action 51747
at 51766
last 51804
was 51962
prompted 52123
by 52137
the 54192
reasons 58894
which 65916
he 67732
avowed 71557
in 76296
our 78417
conversation 84185
and 90523
by 91967
the 92722
honorable 93839
motives 93862
he 94898
professed 95962
He 100021
immediately 100064
sent 103345
a 104615
copy 104972
of 108874
his 111364
order 112495
to 115004
Mr 117480
Lincoln 122471
personally 123127
and 128901
this 134775
indicates 135663
that 135729
he 137834
believed 138354
the 144965
President 145093
would 146321
be 146765
pleased 149166
with 149181
it 156643
The 160424
reference 163752
which 164116
he 164356
made 164579
to 166218
suggestions 171728
that 172182
the 173548
army 173612
would 173735
follow 183245
him 554
in 6944
a 6969
coup 9169
d'e'tat 14785
is 15897
supported 18549
by 22099
what 22942
he 25183
formally 30309
declared 33597
in 45299
his 49817
memoirs 51163
He 52245
there 59505
tells 71129
us 73115
that 75908
in 83192
he 92244
was 94393
often 96180
approached 97348
in 101459
regard 102474
to 104216
a 105326
dictatorship 105479
and 105896
that 112555
when 113646

was 115338

removed 148890

It 45796
would 67189
seem 14789
that 3788
treasonable 5915
notions 36456
were 39008
rife 45151
about 63119
him 73401
to 82000
an 85903
extent 99888
that 105263
was 109677
never 110370
suspected 128322
unless 128343
he 131678
was 161190
made 174317
the 6066
dupe 27508
of 29703
pretenders 81462
who 82446
saw 111902
some 119079
profit 119384
in 123227
what 124843
might 125785
be 162492
regarded 178012
as 128138
a 10576
gross 81865
form 1407
of 1784
adulation 1811
He 6596
must 6629
be 10122
condemned 10204
for 16735
the 16844
weakness 19910
which 22232
made 23001
such 27132
approaches 29682
to 37621
him 37916
possible 43893
but 47538
we 65043
are 65713
obliged 65889
to 66110
take 66244
the 66539
fact 67893
as 68113
he 68162
gives 68330
it 68521
and 68642
to 69649
accept 73414
as 74070
one 86419
of 99552
the 99579
strange 99680
elements 101923
of 102583
the 103063

a 180696
way 757
to 3332
make 1418
it 65724
more 1445
than 65751
ordinarily 3148
trustworthy 175883
was 48123
that 167180
in 16808
the 28310
summer 45419
of 66163
McClellan 66502
was 131485
riding 170104

the 31860

Footnote 42463
General 43793
McCall 44714
and 49838
said 50288
to 65766
him 65798
I 67018
understand 67804
there 69035
is 73396
a 74918
good 77979
deal 81317
of 84041
talk 123907
of 124859
making 138812
a 148560
dictatorship 150576
Ah 158258

Mr 180563
Lincoln 180739
I 180859
suppose 2676
Oh 147725
no 2109
replied 111472
McClellan 3262
it's 175997
me 48530
they're 8778
talking 48236
of 137045
Bits 41801
of 42229
evidence 44748
from 101072
many 101100
sources 108551
prove 117229
that 4422
there 61685
had 52281
been 155553
from 7868
the 56860
first 60234
too 95686
much 143195
such 23740
talk 173632
about 11755
Washington 44451
and 75805
whilst 52577
McClellan 31304
cannot 38939
be 45157
held 53398
responsible 55087
for 81739
it 90771
there 134088
is 157891
no 148922
proof 28990
that 41743
he 100670
rebuked 122850
it 140659
as 56592
he 94017
should 185305
have 21511
done 27491
It 38524
was 39042
part 122131
of 159181
the 181997
fermenting 165612
political 42984
and 100808
military 176022
intrigue 15171
which 30916
is 56398
found 90399
at 169898
the 56549
seat 141545
of 4824
government 83735
in 88161
such 13523
a 23483
time 56924
if 75089
anywhere 152173
and 13184
I 114324
take 90847
satisfaction 141258
in 169026
testifying 2458
that 140374
away 91166
from 141426
that 57860
neighborhood 109204
I 119021
never 29234
even 45096
heard 46742
the 110463
thing 64418
mentioned 63889
or 150832
referred 84664
to 147059
that 30840
I 31053
can 92638
recollect 31041
Washington 36899
would 7013
be 7167
spoken 23196
of 23456
in 23628
a 25340
general 25691
way 26146
as 26774
a 28388
place 28743
of 29158
intrigues 29671
but 45091
I 46390
never 48451
knew 49495
this 50823
to 52666
have 53421
a 62992
wider 64022
meaning 65860
given 67793
to 71510
it 73591
than 74093
the 76574
ordinary 77018
one 92235

political 94105

lawful 97101

our 135632
camp 148250
on 165322
the 165956
1st 172680
of 173283
October 174931

remained 115344
two 21358
or 29701
three 31523
days 40570
I 66806
was 80006
with 81244
the 91986
party 99665
of 102065
officers 120977
invited 125385
by 157991
McClellan 158871
to 179764
accompany 7152
the 16875
President 23273
in 48040
a 59426
ride 69531
over 71746
the 75513
route 81238
which 81909
Sumner 85821
had 89059
followed 125481
in 135517
the 146620
battle 156709
We 161934
crossed 166683
the 167143
Antietam 167258
in 167943
front 168651
of 174679
Keedysville 179633
followed 90419
the 175505
hollows 67265
and 55996
byways 96727
to 4894
the 8858
East 8987
Wood 9365
and 16064
passed 26539
through 28899
this 31717
and 51011
the 53577
cornfields 53585
which 58668
had 75679
been 90701
the 119744
scene 119971
of 120974
Hooker's 120994
and 121060
Mansfield's 121795
fierce 123756
fighting 124010
We 141166
visited 142918
the 152478
Dunker 154171
Church 154417
and 154677
then 154740
returned 157155
to 157209

Bloody 775
Lane 3350
and 67277
the 67307
central 31330

bridge 38822
The 2672
President 3513
was 4406
observant 4412
and 4442
keenly 4604
interested 11907
in 14131
the 16285
field 17280
of 22954
battle 58363
but 58493
made 58510
no 58594
display 58601
of 58868
sentiment 58874
On 58880
another 59187
day 62838
he 68063
reviewed 70313
the 84441
troops 103050
which 112892
were 119246
most 119595
accessible 119633
from 119648
headquarters 119701
As 120126
my 120181
own 120924
corps 121536

the 122417
first 122492
on 123572

list 137096
I 139722
did 142723

join 142911

the 146092
President 146352
at 147721
the 149299

We 120374
were 120723
ordered 144199
to 144764
be 154377
under 120646
arms 145586
at 121710
eight 153816
o'clock 61438
but 86691
it 141584
was 151262
more 29580
than 40887
two 50133
hours 55981
after 126537
that 162496

the 4487
reviewing 4961
cortege 7488
came 8640
on 8709
the 9050
ground 11849
The 16318
officers 17451
were 17537
very 51537
hilarious 57356
over 58687
some 58803
grotesque 59855
story 73939
with 86867
which 98949
Mr 124013
Lincoln 140742
had 150858
seasoned 155907
the 159920
conversation 14454
and 84528
which 88122
seemed 123950
to 124639
have 18189
caused 30464
some 57764
forgetfulness 84693
of 84713
the 19614
appointment 20916
with 25011
the 37309
troops 69128
We 79038
were 120074
reviewed 155042
by 177714
divisions 178675
and 179104
I 37590
met 108353
the 119674
party 173665
with 69941
my 139990
staff 21537
riding 960
down 1790
the 2032
lines 2090
with 2440
them 5197
and 11163
answering 12348
the 17502
inquiries 18440
of 18511
the 18554
President 18592
and 19084
the 19124
general 19196
as 19221
to 19397
the 19623
history 19764
and 19814
the 20059
experience 21795

the 23953
different 24306
organizations 25108
as 25213
we 25337
passed 25676
them 25776
The 25873
usual 25942
march 28039
in 28472
review 29147
was 29404
omitted 30645

along 34780
the 35579
lines 35629
formed 35755
in 36837
parade 37365
I 37492
had 37565

the 40003
President 40406
in 40669
Washington 40774
when 40954
I 41029
paid 41121
my 41391
respects 41693
at 42126
the 42681
White 43006
House 43102
and 43437
this 43813
was 45313
my 47484
first 48342
meeting 48373
with 48900
him 48973
after 49070
his 49557
inauguration 49606
His 49615
unpretending 51830
cordiality 52694
was 53880
what 54343
first 64957
impressed 66189
one 67153
but 68796
you 69465
soon 70843
saw 71840
with 71913
what 72027
sharp 72910
intelligence 73018
and 73122
keen 73166
humor 74117
he 74252
dealt 74315
with 74797
every 74983
subject 78723
which 79243
came 79931
up 80104
He 80475
referred 81213
very 81706
pleasantly 81747
to 82577
his 82625
knowledge 88684
of 90178
me 90675
through 91085
Secretary 91552
Chase 92246
showing 93618
the 95657
kindly 95679
instinct 96066
to 96370
find 97182
some 97273
compliment 97558
or 97705
evidence 97768
of 98050
recognition 99503
for 99558
all 99822
who 100508
approached 100951
him 100990
This 101637
geniality 101974
in 102148
Mr 102202
Lincoln 102696
made 103124
him 103413
avoid 104118
personal 104959
criticism 105198
of 105279
the 105310
campaign 105367
and 105499
gave 105614
an 105689
air 107291
of 107596
earnest 109153
satisfaction 109433
to 109670
what 110504
he 110598
said 110977
of 111119
the 111181
work 111395
done 111453
by 111752
McClellan 111948
There 113699
was 113892
enough 113910
to 113933
praise 114249
and 114742
he 114807
praised 115056
it 116250
heartily 116309
He 116892
was 117053
also 117280
thankful 117308
that 117431
the 118325
threatened 119190
invasion 119444
of 127897
the 127922
North 127956
had 128843
been 128960
defeated 129188
and 129264
showed 129473
his 129638
sense 130525
of 131792
great 131837
relief 132094
He 132530
had 133012
adopted 133879
the 137984
rule 138144
for 138778
himself 140356
to 140527
limit 154685
his 155281
direct 156058
influence 157050
upon 157781
his 163195
generals 167047
to 167096
the 170399
presentation 170690
of 171621
his 173130
ideas 178042
of 178800
what 178875
was 179452
desirable 179940
often 180318
taking 180632
pains 180925
even 181164
in 1493
his 73785
written 882
communications 16242
to 1573
say 80944
that 2137
he 118826
made 1127
no 1984
order 8847
and 8940
left 9004
the 18411
definite 19163
direction 20575
to 26519
General 26681
Halleck 28663
McClellan 37081
gave 37662
the 48570
most 50346
favorable 58254
interpretation 69925
to 71493
all 72483
that 81253
the 82549
President 82690
said 88539
but 102304
could 102321
not 103762
ignore 104043
the 110407
anxiety 111347
Mr 111496
Lincoln 111552
showed 128831
that 128850
an 129225
energetic 131567
campaign 136803
should 137506
be 138730
continued 164902
He 167071
wrote 170355
home 171650
I 179817
incline 181080
to 2311
think 130995
that 1820
the 99588
real 1810
purpose 99578
of 42149
his 83514
visit 127183
is 157315
to 85039
push 141535
me 62435
into 178631
a 184035
premature 154994
advance 19687

The 101712
President 113265
had 118605
coupled 122197
his 132178
earliest 137278
telegraphic 138360
congratulations 158290
with 158337
the 173873
question 182914
Can't 5621
you 83836
beat 175798
them 178230
some 8190
more 13898
before 18450
they 20959
get 23013
off 23864
and 32439
McClellan's 33370
private 36631
correspondence 37983
shows 39957
that 42299
he 42454
on 45192
his 46016
part 47300
chafed 47589
at 47708
every 48687
suggestion 48813
of 49128
haste 49584
As 51723
early 51910
as 52473
the 52858
22d 53865
of 58795
September 66395
the 66439
general 71679
had 71946
written 72136
that 72251
he 72646
looked 73182
upon 75137
the 75446
campaign 75821
as 78422
substantially 78931
ended 79073
and 80500
intended 86401
to 89737
give 90722
some 95162
time 109364
to 113591
the 115567
reorganization 121950
of 122258
the 125362
army 125841
before 128530
beginning 129333
a 133407
new 134820
one 135741
The 136814
vicinity 137011
of 137076
Harper's 137927
Ferry 138501
or 139472
Frederick 159546
seemed 162042
to 164586
him 166620
the 171174
proper 171469
place 172545
for 175731
the 176855
camp 176976
meanwhile 177755
and 180036
he 180054
wished 180722
for 9820
a 91143
rise 172109
in 181907
the 1167
Potomac 11421
River 27253
which 29386
should 29424
make 29442
it 29527
impracticable 29769
for 29899
Lee 30335
to 30906
ford 31809
it 32175
again 32269
He 33085
delayed 33183
in 36910
the 38738
neighborhood 43756
of 44679
Sharpsburg 44949
waiting 44961
for 45026
this 45283
To 45575
those 45682
of 46148
us 46204
with 46267
whom 46578
he 46728
talked 47401
freely 47692
he 48252
spoke 48308
of 48580
the 51135
necessity 51379
of 51797
incorporating 55396
into 60155
the 60223
Army 60799
of 61268
the 64482
Potomac 67205
at 69564
least 69588
a 72217
hundred 74319
thousand 75024
of 75950
the 129169
new 129198
levies 129212
to 131606
make 132124
it 132463
really 132856
fit 132908
for 134176
an 148679
aggressive 148969
campaign 149860
and 157760
argued 165206
that 165246
it 166880
would 167007
save 169170
time 179092
in 181106
the 993
end 29068
to 1018
use 29093
some 91604
of 106070
it 27225
now 60419
in 61572
the 150894
work 78528
of 82
reorganizing 42579
Mr 49661
Lincoln 51175
was 98373
plainly 108670
troubled 114559
with 137840
the 181121
apprehension 183465
that 183556
the 183598
delays 183747
of 184944
were 82404
to 12805
be 20076
repeated 86964
and 175283
that 113035
the 17257
fine 3018
October 8849
weather 29303
of 29370
that 33207
region 37214
would 41515
be 42058
again 43988
wasted 47739
and 51181
nothing 51233
done 59931
till 60111
the 62195
next 62217
spring 69467
There 76556
were 131408
men 133061
enough 136528
about 138593
him 138793
at 139045
Washington 139141
to 139238
remind 139402
him 139431
of 142276
this 148258
in 148372
irritating 161006
ways 162993
and 163024
to 163413
make 164398
him 166959
realize 169059
that 172116
as 173056
he 179313
had 181301
personally 4699
restored 98964
McClellan 79821
to 93589
the 63895
command 63900
he 95373
would 95531
be 106347
personally 109961
responsible 829
for 9887
keeping 13996
him 92552
moving 82653
McClellan 6793
rightly 11295
understood 27627
Mr 28291
Lincoln's 31268
visit 39125
as 64983
meaning 66331
this 74941
He 77258
did 81428
not 86540
refuse 87585
to 88136
move 93858
on 121496
the 127935
other 139672
hand 146637
he 149712
professed 152240
to 153102
be 153280
anxious 153675
to 153813
do 154998
so 155012
at 155150
the 155165
earliest 155856
moment 156124
when 156154
it 156202
should 156524
be 156802
really 170780
practicable 175410
His 53944
obstinacy 65308
was 114087
of 127432
a 128374
feminine 129792
sort 137095
He 142722
avoided 144898
open 146360
antagonism 149491
which 155092
would 11556
have 54381
been 88162
a 89056
challenge 89479
of 119483
strength 123660
but 154077
found 156083
constantly 161432
fresh 12527
obstacles 16566
in 16664
the 16760
way 16935
of 17224
doing 17380
what 18150
he 18295
was 18632
determined 18658
from 19186
the 19439
first 19447
not 19852
to 19858
do 20460
The 21036
need 21129
of 23441
clothing 28811
for 33333
the 33535
men 33541
and 34149
of 34813
horses 35372
for 35555
the 36748
cavalry 37134
was 37896
a 39857
fruitful 40006
subject 40765
for 40877
debate 41355
and 42083
the 48576
debate 49375
if 49470
sufficiently 49642
prolonged 50557
would 50626
itself 50672
accomplish 50880
the 56541
delay 59652
that 63729
was 67463
desired 68455
The 70635
official 70666
correspondence 70767
shows 70770
that 70889
the 71328
President 72171
went 72386
back 73219
to 74406
Washington 74541
determined 74836
to 75505
cut 75917
the 76113
knot 76164
in 76341
a 76540
peremptory 76776
way 76781
if 77088
he 77552
was 77588
forced 77654
to 77872
do 77926
so 78162
McClellan 78355
could 79523
not 79527
have 79533
been 79710
blind 80296
to 80625
this 81221
His 83153
private 83918
letters 84272
show 84680
that 85025
he 85931
thought 86034
it 86086
not 86153
improbable 86469
that 86652
he 87346
would 87377
be 87432
relieved 88001
from 88525
command 93413
His 96426
desire 96447
for 98769
military 104086
success 104316
was 105891
a 106714
ruling 107349
one 107669
with 107859
him 108311
on 109453
both 111257
public 112827
and 112977
private 113089
grounds 114883
We 116280
are 116944
forced 117133
therefore 117926
to 121947
conclude 122204
that 127603
he 131475
actually 132685
lacked 133628
faith 134297
in 135553
success 135963
and 136078
regarded 136374
the 136478
crossing 136582
of 136795
the 136975
Potomac 137049
as 137162
too 137349
perilous 137649
until 138077
he 138388
should 139070
reorganize 139567
the 140600
army 141753
with 142568
the 143285
additional 144095
hundred 145925
thousand 148510
recruits 154583
In 156953
this 157754
we 158610
see 158723
the 159099
ever-recurring 159497
effect 159648
of 160653
his 161185
exaggeration 161650
of 162341
the 162390
enemy's 164384
force 166074
We 166312
now 166456
know 166932
that 167494
this 167715
over-estimate 168352
was 168488
inexcusable 168736
but 169555
we 169561
cannot 170224
deny 170661
that 172038
he 172041
made 172201
it 172287
nor 172918
altogether 173450
that 173824
he 175474
believed 175479
in 176334
it 181478
It 6214
constituted 29473
a 29791
disqualification 46206
for 72201
such 101412
a 115931
command 123336
and 134763
led 138303
to 158257
what 171000
must 180080
be 6101
regarded 9660
as 44453
the 59491
inevitable 59592
result 61390
--his 61628
removal 61870
The 61933
political 63855
questions 64471
connected 64930
with 66740
the 67439
matter 152156
cut 154254
no 155008
important 8970
figure 56106
in 57049
it 65577
If 74254
he 76631
had 83816
had 86614
faith 154611
in 155766
his 158450
ability 174400
to 177449
conquer 179457
Lee's 182744
army 12897
we 59235
should 61409
never 62683
have 75936
heard 119310
of 152402
them 146737
Whilst 152367
I 57898
mean 70606
what 61586
I 62987
say 139649
in 152076
speaking 168924
of 79469
McClellan's 122910
exaggeration 90446
of 122913
his 142618
enemy 145734
as 126517
constituting 8402
incompetence 165890
for 8367
such 89000
a 128533
command 42582
it 43266
has 80772
reference 102049
to 146499
the 146551
necessity 113113
in 35799
which 39653
we 43186
were 49809
that 73233
our 75533
army 81272
should 98946
be 118956
aggressively 128573
handled 131639
Few 151424
men 152350
could 168119
excel 170721
him 179134
in 179708
strictly 100051
defensive 152622
operations 32279
He 46394
did 30018
not 37460
lack 964
personal 21746
courage 21799
nor 28767
did 101795
his 132225
intellectual 133120
powers 134003
become 178355
obscured 178511
in 29982
the 32112
excitement 38821
of 64144
actual 144440
war 96748
He 140956
showed 151626
the 152505
ordinary 157443
evidences 53264
of 62921
presence 81686
of 85540
mind 150636
and 43604
coolness 65817
of 3742
judgment 145746
under 160843
fire 515
His 10500
tendency 16721
to 53015
see 87172
his 89183
enemy 134019
doubled 139780
in 180744
force 62748
was 164761
however 91019
a 152638
constitutional 51329
one 17615
and 69847
no 88527
amount 102942
of 112767
experience 112939
seemed 113062
to 158519
cure 163863
it 164339
Had 120872
it 123033
not 165759
been 5613
so 6161
he 8013
would 14169
have 15870
devised 60620
checks 60978
upon 61767
the 62429
reports 63326
of 64660
his 137201
secret-service 142421
agents 163680
and 171518
corrected 176689
their 177518
estimates 18612
by 19205
those 27026
more 37265
reliable 47775
methods 66991
which 69025
I 116002
have 158898
already 60514
spoken 45643
of 47631
McClellan 48393
was 67836
even 74075
in 81182
those 82393
days 115638
often 115739
compared 178298
to 183937
Marshal 183943
Daun 6605
whose 12406
fair 15586
ability 17255
but 22372
studiously 26763
defensive 29041
policy 41042
was 46657
so 47673
in 66866
contrast 76800
with 77155
the 80029
daring 84003
strategy 88197
of 92444
the 94295
great 94576
Frederick 105022
The 108902
comparison 129487
was 144435
a 171802
fair 176657
one 595
The 24377
trouble 25968
was 97153
that 97619
we 111529
had 117813
need 137417
of 177368
a 118492
Frederick 174764
It 76879
may 15491
seem 21834
strange 30806
that 33738
his 38448
subordinates 42787
so 43505
generally 47081
accepted 48302
his 49308
view 49787
and 50357
supported 56456
him 57582
in 65078
his 69942
conduct 75234
but 86291
it 86537
was 90743
a 115485
natural 118153
result 123675
of 127976
forces 130851
always 146295
at 176174
work 178406
in 6042
an 6193
army 10710
The 18788
old 21962
maxim 22231
that 34186
Councils 39363
of 50946
war 56191
never 61382
fight 69292
is 71492
only 78333
another 82417
way 82730
of 88965
saying 89418
that 98848
an 99304
army 100013
is 101515
never 104526
bolder 118722
than 120261
its 126737
leader 126843
It 127200
is 135578
the 136174
same 138117
as 138785
the 139792
old 155098
Greek 159280
proverb 160374
Better 160703
an 162074
army 162949
of 163113
deer 165379
with 166197
a 168801
lion 173015
for 173021
leader 174583
than 174974
an 175582
army 177700
of 179816
lions 180010
with 181058
a 63807
deer 122954
for 203
leader 17392
The 50371
body 71227
of 92654
men 125997
thus 126865
organized 158077
relies 175053
upon 146288
its 120201
chief 70550
for 120204
the 124637
knowledge 156983
of 174762
the 183057
enemy 476
and 4816
for 13773
the 92953
plan 106833
by 108445
which 111094
the 128726
enemy 173625
is 77216
to 146040
be 2733
taken 152767
at 155875
a 49019
disadvantage 49052
It 59272
will 103126
courageously 115831
carry 138491
out 152621
his 161477
plans 583
so 37383
long 37406
as 71769
he 71885
has 110888
faith 145817
in 161119
them 168504
himself 169324
and 172059
has 178980
good 7949
fortune 46792
in 48516
their 67791
execution 138538
Let 8388
doubt 56271
arise 57929
as 63447
to 119395
either 148012
of 154657
these 9470
things 26894
and 82437
his 85963
troops 124181
raise 164707
the 165679
cry 169141
We 178502
are 38512
sacrificed 66401
We 170692
are 11122
slaughtered 47889
uselessly 155014
McClellan's 7783
arts 21419
of 152031
military 61015
popularity 3517
were 44443
such 56026
that 121110
his 122229
army 169309
accepted 15112
his 18602
estimate 24003
of 26604
the 31314
enemy 35424
and 49911
believed 62248
in 73924
the 80134
main 94910
that 96910
he 97381
had 100008
shown 111092
great 125664
ability 139773
in 150767
saving 150913
them 151538
from 152201
destruction 159331
in 163592
a 163663
contest 171323
at 179339
such 7406
odds 40718
They 51573
were 61948
inclined 17596
therefore 20636
to 13750
hold 15225
the 24787
government 26286
at 40519
Washington 46257
responsible 72133
for 89322
sacrificing 103301
them 105347
by 117884
demanding 129375
the 132493
impossible 142414
Under 146363
such 159721
circumstances 160125
nothing 160824
but 164438
a 183138
cautious 42961
defensive 83310
policy 84119
could 101801
be 114948
popular 147378
with 148134
officers 152928
or 166731
men 171450
If 34862
McClellan's 70108
data 1645
were 4027
true 52910
he 79797
and 81016
they 86225
were 120895
right 131524
It 132964
would 137519
have 165035
been 182595
folly 3729
to 149210
cross 152973
the 44283
Potomac 52588
and 54284
with 57924
their 83948
backs 96863
to 150622
the 143184
river 39300
fight 32111
a 156720
greatly 63722
superior 81150
enemy 150119
Because 144777
the 6544
data 8791
were 16740
not 18969
true 19094
there 21082
was 23308
no 25154
solution 25185
for 26768
the 27567
problem 29407
but 35073
to 36670
give 37478
the 48335
army 50741
another 51232
commander 67565
and 68301
painfully 70572
to 76554
undo 80191
the 81237
military 88547
education 93227
it 96608
had 98753
for 99481
a 100620
year 101268
been 106311
receiving 110037
The 131910
process 137680
of 138088
disillusion 142242
was 142253
a 148385
slow 149199
one 157845
The 157871
disasters 158031
to 158685
Burnside 167412
and 173341
Hooker 174839
strengthened 178799
the 184977
error 64014
Meade's 64026
standstill 28118
after 46005
Gettysburg 87380
was 119945
very 121558
like 155212
McClellan's 174576
after 39137
Antietam 53008
and 54418
Mr 56473
Lincoln 58284
had 63646
to 63687
deal 63838
with 63922
it 63974
in 73743
a 153076
very 59294
similar 140737
way 152635
When 182608
Grant 22481
took 28319
command 56517
the 63701
army 152686
expected 182738
him 185370
to 22417
have 22268
a 22374
similar 28224
fate 61595
and 64644
his 149880
reputation 153539
was 166790
treated 168876
as 168939
of 41248
little 51760
worth 51822
because 52162
he 70424
had 139971
not 153513
yet 153900
met 153994
Bobby 2736
Lee 152770
His 1635
terrible 17119
method 17171
of 25734
attrition 35601
was 37818
a 38898
fearfully 50055
costly 73071
one 74771
and 81006
the 84891
flower 84903
of 89725
that 92048
army 92435
was 95941
transferred 96281
from 96318
the 100372
active 117098
roster 132712
to 139559
the 141996
casualty 155073
lists 155835
before 156969
the 162991
prestige 164271
of 168328
its 168662
enemy 168751
was 168930
broken 169424
But 171962
it 172001
was 178765
broken 181208
and 181417
Appomattox 181475
came 155841
at 440
last 1069
It 1136
will 26543
not 28204
do 29144
to 36893
say 37090
that 41755
the 51599
Confederate 53655
army 59296
in 61512
Virginia 81500
was 81980
in 88239
any 123064
sense 123445
superior 123476
to 126291
their 126407
army 127366
in 129921
the 139758
West 142961
When 146825
the 147203
superior 147980
force 151068
of 151863
the 152245
National 168827
army 168888
was 170516
systematically 180195
applied 44572
General 44561
Lee 57454
was 61726
reduced 168301
to 175534
as 25422
cautious 156130
a 61037
defensive 79461
in 16045
Virginia 45248
as 180161
was 50026
General 76073
Johnston 83240
in 103223
Georgia 107088
Longstreet 113382
and 146171
Hood 147108
had 157910
no 158854
better 159238
success 159958
when 161265
transferred 163162
to 165694
the 168739
West 5851
than 6317
the 22951
men 27424
who 27800
had 28263
never 36283
belonged 40033
to 57814
the 59193
Army 68545
of 75798
Virginia 80659
In 83655
fact 85933
it 87244
was 91362
with 96633
Joseph 108032
E 109984
Johnston 114587
as 127398
his 133874
opponent 138915
that 138950
McClellan's 139573
career 147377
was 157985
chiefly 160237
run 166736
Yet 170435
the 171563
Confederate 174738
army 177972
in 182209
the 13078
West 39066
was 50161
broken 50430
at 56149
Donelson 62059
and 63591
at 65101
Vicksburg 85262
It 124061
was 124472
driven 129424
from 184526
Stone's 2848
River 157519
to 198
Chattanooga 5707
and 56444
from 63487
Missionary 51716
Ridge 9915
to 15609
Atlanta 17246
Its 22054
remnant 76379
was 92749
destroyed 133608
at 137206
Franklin 46237
and 77424
Nashville 129210
and 143926
Sherman's 135749
March 49860
to 153886
the 155691
Sea 155722
nearly 2742
completed 152776
the 13246
traverse 16712
of 55450
the 77502
whole 119758
Confederacy 124084
His 129926
victorious 129983
army 147031
was 147041
close 147049
in 155120
rear 2188
of 118877
Petersburg 64509
when 183713
Richmond 24477
was 152364
finally 152480
won 169923
Now 3937
that 17473
we 18652
have 18958
got 75881
rid 119519
of 121430
the 121434
fiction 154459
that 154938
the 156137
Confederate 156821
government 2702
gave 147751
to 21271
Lee 21396
an 31446
enormously 70378
larger 7348
army 11448
than 53572
it 55768
gave 64188
to 146091
Bragg 10425
or 55451
to 62649
Joseph 66317
Johnston 77893
we 162453
have 136426
to 158617
account 136399
for 150821
the 185445
fact 128
that 6012
with 170800
much 171331
less 182577
odds 185348
in 160919
their 184686
favor 39350
our 52690
Western 122108
army 122290
accomplished 123320
so 4161
much 86394
more 5984
As 12205
a 14478
military 14896
objective 30711
Richmond 32031
was 34659
in 38768
easier 58288
reach 58427
from 58481
the 58392
Potomac 59880
than 60095
Nashville 60993
from 61325
the 61473
Ohio 62931
From 63451
Nashville 70305
to 94107
Chattanooga 59858
was 4381
fully 58368
as 11866
difficult 38663
a 14053
task 60703
The 80219
vulnerable 697
lines 34388
of 56192
communication 122233
multiplied 184908
in 164365
length 8904
as 10942
we 64166
went 146817
southward 55229
and 183873
made 5481
the 52352
campaign 77539
of 1318
Atlanta 17297
more 25001
difficult 25638
still 26429
Vicksburg 26706
was 28702
a 30958
harder 33511
nut 44235
to 46835
crack 56697
than 76413
Richmond 88914
We 98269
must 103587
put 103712
away 108220
our 109343
esprit 115163
de 116654
corps 129238
and 135298
squarely 137848
face 140692
the 142029
problem 154975
as 155318
one 156230
of 157677
military 166363
art 166624
with 172741
the 174076
Official 58269
Records 177364
and 103200
returns 68531
before 121861
us 185226
Our 158208
Western 47956
army 15850
was 123400
of 53672
essentially 82880
the 135998
same 152290
material 285
as 1330
the 26357
Eastern 42965
Regiments 53112
from 53324
nearly 53753
all 54247
the 56709

were 67875
mingled 70522
in 83457
both 111775

important 41026
and 87801
one 88435
of 88447
the 88455
gravest 96597
lessons 121000
the 133677
world 147833
has 155564
ever 157015
seen 161282
I 170232
have 3510
to 28205
confess 47880
that 47896
at 55328
Antietam 55385
I 56089
shared 75692
more 90720
or 136525
less 182879
fully 184239
the 10986
opinions 53951
of 57399
those 58654
among 61862
whom 115701
I 145764
was 157733
I 162143
accepted 165172
McClellan 35267
as 149422
the 8773
best 171202
authority 6732
in 154373
regard 889
to 16249
the 52976
enemy's 125779
numbers 165096
and 180602
assuming 65908
that 68092
he 68174
was 69664
approximately 82942
right 83284
in 94086
that 180703
the 83804
reasonable 183708
prudence 70356
of 152574
waiting 174999
for 169807
reinforcements 98686
could 154407
not 156441
be 156980
denied 151095
I 100810
saw 6347
that 7901
he 16406
had 26072
lost 27997
valuable 29389
time 34953
in 42306
the 43992
movements 45573
of 66793
the 68183
campaign 70554
but 74521
the 78089
general 78152
result 78885
seemed 86144
successful 106091
enough 135519
to 151876
hide 158029
this 158881
for 169356
the 172863
time 181379
at 182667
least 182779
My 29758
own 32995
experience 48241
therefore 105832
supports 102370
the 132036
conclusion 167477
I 13343
have 26205
already 31290
stated 42320
that 101592
an 140903
army's 174444
enterprise 178941
is 180962
measured 8104
by 76522
its 128469
commander's 137121
and 168374
by 11050
a 27447
necessary 50797
law 94045
the 172278
army 153705
reflects 180200
his 15065
judgment 126458
as 126488
to 12510
what 24742
it 25332
can 38409
or 43159
cannot 64970
accomplish 83760
Mr 88215
Lincoln 100109
had 113537
told 122375
McClellan 138043
during 139510
his 143851
visit 154364
to 4376
the 10342
army 10804
that 10880
his 20828
great 28265
fault 29677
was 34592
overcautiousness 57501
He 67328
had 73608
intimated 74948
plainly 77385
enough 84087
that 89512
he 102189
must 116733
insist 128365
upon 131698
the 148873
continuance 149319
of 151337
the 165983
campaign 18233
He 57720
had 59033
discussed 70812
the 85372
plans 88028
of 101859
advance 118270
and 176107
urged 123849
McClellan 179196
to 57575
operate 64654
upon 87668
Lee's 51719
communications 59145
by 133394
marching 147338
south 173926

east 183770
side 183982
of 184056
the 184465
Blue 184808
Ridge 184847
He 7586
had 38150
disclaimed 85786
any 143973
purpose 144004
of 144051
forcing 149099
a 150670
movement 157653
before 179559
the 183862
army 184456
was 184545
ready 13373
but 15044
saw 30758
no 144272
reason 183496
why 183853
it 184484
should 184668
take 91370

adopted 80299
Halleck 80358

adopt 109766

distinctly 112825
that 113087

use 114581
that 114881

the 116278
enemy 116547
should 116801
retire 117131
beyond 117924
Winchester 121382

he 125114
did 125340
not 125676
expect 126856
to 127149
be 127601
able 128150
to 128719

If 136580

new 138923
and 139565
decisive 140854
line 141233
of 141287
operations 142566
He 146158
objected 147641
to 148240
the 152458
interior 152582
line 152597
because 154545
it 156411

not 157750
cover 158528
Maryland 158721

Pennsylvania 159389
from 159746
a 159875
return 160406

Lee's 161183

because 162111
as 162549
he 162961
said 164382
the 164592
army 165127
could 165256
not 165493
be 166072
supplied 166276
by 166454
it 166930
He 167492
indicated 167713
three 168350
days 168672
as 168813
the 169117
time 169553
within 170222
which 170659
he 171034
could 171489

At 171882
the 172036
end 172039
of 172199
that 172664

he 172938
complained 173183
of 173278
still 173448
lacking 173562
clothing 173628
On 173822
the 173910
12th 174231
he 174234
found 174302
it 174671
absolutely 174970
necessary 175188
that 175193
the 175296

The 177557

the 6756

his 36996
mental 53390

He 54497
exhausted 56001

enemy's 154858
communications 176242
He 26583
pointed 98940
out 152136
that 74935
if 8710
Lee 36311
should 117156
try 140803
to 149620
cross 149635
the 152427
Potomac 156975
our 157221
army 89374
could 89620
be 10362
in 126499
his 126482
rear 86856
and 145825
should 175331
destroy 11644
him 22159
He 265
showed 2995
that 7532
McClellan 10046
at 12383
Harper's 13308
Ferry 21859
was 25937
nearer 28075
to 31704
Richmond 32857
than 32873
Lee 35492
His 43899
route 50066
is 50578
the 54357
arc 55916
of 64608
a 64725
circle 70243
of 72113
which 72279
yours 76074
is 81151
the 83136
chord 86891
He 89462
analyzed 93979
the 97489
map 98523
and 99707
showed 102063
that 102110
the 105412
interior 108500
line 109227
was 112979
the 117441
easier 118297
for 120145
supplying 120690
the 123023
army 124885
The 128262
chord 136718
line 137193
as 137487
you 140166
see 147755
carries 149897
you 150082
by 150160
Aldie 150678
Haymarket 151832
and 152493
Fredericksburg 153434
and 158713
you 159460
see 159578
how 162063
turnpikes 163009
railroads 163390
and 166585
finally 168957
the 170342
Potomac 170842
by 170912
Acquia 170935
Creek 171630
meet 172646
you 173331
at 176225
all 177589
points 178567
from 178969
Washington 182722
He 812
even 9870
gave 3178
the 175913
figures 23279
in 66452
miles 68258
from 24195
gap 45241
to 47869
gap 61378
in 11758
the 27572
mountains 30393
which 46033
would 67130
enable 119596
McClellan 130081
to 145650
strike 150578
the 153317
enemy 153489
in 166163
flank 166830
or 179705
rear 35189
and 83058
this 120704
was 34305
of 56303
course 60808
to 156246
be 180707
done 109637
if 109869
Lee 168202
made 178495
a 9658
stand 20264
It 20305
is 20333
all 20410
easy 20785
his 20810
letter 80718
concluded 132115
if 161375
our 164993
troops 165366
march 166173
as 166263
well 167670
as 168394
the 168506
enemy 168656
and 171281
it 181176
is 2988
unmanly 163383
to 31839
say 64805
they 33565
cannot 45729
do 47928
it 48706
Yet 49445
he 49960
expressly 71643
disclaimed 71896
making 78082
his 79881
letter 95800
an 109753

Since 116513

this 128711
I 158322
have 159403

treat 26874
this 27259

of 73083
the 77507
strategic 85059

Mr 167954
Lincoln 3927
head 4196
and 5237
shoulders 6067
above 6169
both 6886
his 7808
military 9278
subordinates 10048
Halleck 10738
saw 10930
its 11378
force 14283
but 16540
would 17153
not 19383
order 24070
it 28078

be 32344
carried 34315
out 36018
McClellan 38253
shrank 41942
from 42607
the 43670
decisive 45629
vigor 46668
of 47133
the 47425
plan 48064
though 48491
he 48808
finally 49475
accepted 53802
it 55238
as 55745
the 55955
means 58499
of 60671
getting 61739

the 81692

that 117620
in 117763
other 118176

he 119651
was 120715
nearly 121975
ready 124462
to 124657
move 128728
and 130028
inquires 130910
whether 132092
the 132314
President 133798
desired 136535
him 137938
to 138356
march 138456
on 138990
the 139515
enemy 144032
at 147567

arrival 153535
of 154129
the 154204
new 154307

Halleck 158915
answered 160008
that 161755
the 164728
order 165164
of 165940
the 166081
6th 166640
October 166698
remained 167045
unchanged 167172
If 171909
you 172871
have 173664
not 173680
been 174433
and 174558
are 177981
not 178914
now 179175
in 180748
condition 35679
to 79280
obey 85490
it 98789
you 125607
will 11007
be 24253
able 27496
to 35108
show 74930
such 79747
want 84324
of 87101
ability 96533
The 100681
President 102652
does 140107
not 145596
expect 162687
impossibilities 172758
but 180628
he 34726
is 101620
very 133316
anxious 21404
that 39471
all 172626
this 58456
good 64977
weather 58004
should 142225
not 39402
be 301

you 135790
will 142377

on 182443
what 2394
lines 131078
you 1710
propose 88599
to 1275
march 56654
This 57122
dispatch 57249
was 57346
plainly 58221
a 65161
notice 65248
to 89643
McClellan 119726
that 926
he 21761
would 164184
be 67263
held 11610
responsible 40011
for 119634
the 126783
failure 150770
to 156580
obey 170776
the 41332
order 139633
of 170824
the 91568
6th 91744
unless 98897
he 141992
could 178233
exonerate 8290
himself 8438
by 27975
showing 38020
that 47087
he 47335
could 55441
not 60379
obey 67715
it 79641
In 84967
his 85033
final 117367
report 131378
however 136214
he 136227
says 142290
that 12784
he 13493
treated 15421
it 51950
as 62273
authority 72749
to 90653
decide 174485
for 1182
himself 44694
whether 150917
or 179492
not 42279
it 132460
was 136538
possible 142271
to 10182
move 11251
with 11305
safety 12746
to 15254
the 15408
army 36168
Footnote 36216
Ibid 44897
and 46810
this 55636
responsibility 69576
he 80089
says 88905
I 103948
exercised 114955
with 122654
the 135307
more 147409
confidence 150467
in 151069
view 151172
of 164784
the 3229
strong 175964
assurance 49863
of 157609
his 63884
trust 64016
in 12077
me 36302
as 75116
commander 64033
of 182106
that 7995
army 130249
with 170733
which 11203
the 11788
President 14280
had 27430
seen 37930
fit 39109
to 45991
honor 53295
me 54321
during 54703
his 57206
last 61347
visit 61400
Argument 62805
is 63582
superfluous 63928
in 76281
view 82406
of 83623
the 85617
correspondence 86104
to 99034
show 112122
that 119501
orders 120050
and 120064
exhortations 120812
were 120971
alike 121198
wasted 123051
The 130069
movement 130853
began 130873
in 139170
the 144890
last 145955
days 148507
of 149379
October 153063
the 153754
Sixth 153784

on 161418
the 161683
2d 169513

November 182037
McClellan 1451
had 65757
accepted 3235
Mr 175970
Lincoln's 142553
plan 170575
but 11126
lack 51019
of 57463
vigor 64234
in 79401
its 80598
execution 83583
broke 84918
down 128084
the 130883
President's 142940
patience 142953
and 143155
on 2518

5th 39046
of 117994
November 123573
upon 140434
Lee's 144135

the 159682
Blue 159854
Ridge 160307
without 167787
a 19386
battle 2942
he 8672
ordered 36028
the 38552
general 51542
to 52262
turn 64897
over 73953
the 91893
command 91931
to 155159
Burnside 163337
as 180328
he 91705
had 180368
declared 134217
he 7919
would 11918
do 11940
if 11986
Lee's 16660
was 24867
allowed 36098
to 36974
regain 39016
the 47149
interior 48211
line 52180
The 57518
order 58281
was 68578
presented 68621
and 69719
obeyed 74384
on 76434
the 81931
7th 97804
and 109625
McClellan 116805
left 119147
the 138358

The 159544
fallen 164584
general 174634
brooded 174654
morbidly 5895
over 8506
it 11134
all 15402
for 27816
twenty 27867
years 35360
and 43229
then 44200
wrote 70137
his 81434
Own 143526
Story 150417
a 1803
most 99571
curious 67302
piece 56525
of 137675
self-exposure 24283
in 25953
which 26547
he 45932
unconsciously 69850
showed 82819
that 83252
the 90648
illusions 92473
which 140657
had 144934
misguided 172463
him 10455
in 8212
his 9317
campaigns 10627
were 13535
still 14264
realities 14539
to 14970
him 21444
and 27412
that 34425
he 35105
had 35747
made 39333
no 46104
use 49310
of 50025
the 64049

brought 98506
within 103845
his 112809
reach 120343
He 134851
had 150648
forgotten 156179

the 73822
demonstrative 3682

They 146867

old 146560
self 146579

have 149067
thus 158770
far 177417
struggled 60712

feel 14015
very 44146
proud 61743
of 61852
Yorktown 82042

proud 111635

very 132359
grateful 137885
to 138026
God 164560
that 165705
he 165846
allowed 168393

purchase 62767
such 45866
great 58261

life 35766
The 37650
crisis 41005
cannot 42741

on 90262
our 91469
arms 95324

rely 114543
far 115928
more 129331

sincere 89397
When 118891

weak 55244

myself 85771
I 93507
can 127440

a 165880
chosen 167958
instrument 81465

the 157173
night 2751
for 152785
them 156972
Burnside 90226
took 123731
the 156312
responsibility 177919
of 8792
allowing 59503
the 167020
corps 92944
to 152623
wait 65985
until 81141
these 127807
supplies 5080
came 39621
and 46720
the 52295
men 64844
could 74844
be 99843
fed 122936
before 158135
marching 11413
again 123876
It 66557
will 78473
be 86608

The 66308

course 124628
conclusive 125035
but 140913
it 140990
leaves 143734
the 144020
difficult 147348
problem 159048
how 183941
came 2850
the 157521

General 185221
McClellan 115965
could 80678

as 13453
the 67599
interruption 158467
of 154383
Burnside's 181406

it 30804
was 54303

must 175339

it 140471
since 145445
Colonel 145145
Richmond's 7105

that 12515
General 17352
Seth 54262
Williams's 144816
name 144820
was 145427
finally 142751
attached 2493
All 140409
of 4493
us 17548
who 32742
knew 51479

Williams 75712
and 86185
his 91506
methods 155432

business 19719
will 24672
be 33724
slow 49245
to 49821
believe 71230
that 73011
he 93824
volunteered 95495
a 98278
paper 103707
of 114120
that 114712
kind 116332
He 116660
afterward 138186
served 149815
on 152815
Burnside's 153797
own 155469
staff 155586
and 156754
had 156874
his 177606
confidence 78958

General 8152
Marcy 27043
the 28552
chief 43795
of 69960

of 143694
the 4146
officers 31635
of 31679
that 143609
army 1005
will 29080
be 32890
likely 51711
to 100141
conclude 159340
that 157258
he 170004
also 57093
would 83960
act 29583
only 29856
by 165217

decisive 70019
authority 121643
to 55846
speak 129058
for 129405
him 38444

it 86365
in 87293
his 90061
official 104748
report 122395
certainly 123295
indicates 123994
no 125795
friendly 127875
disposition 142073
toward 155643
Burnside 3041
To 8600
that 18920
extent 19733
it 22387
supports 22596
any 24088
other 24897
circumstances 25063
which 26759
point 27263
to 31614
Porter 39845
as 40866
the 43835
hostile 43981
influence 46802
which 49046
becomes 71352
so 71384
manifest 73253
at 73451
McClellan's 76841
headquarters 76874
after 77008
the 78252
14th 89377
of 90132
September 90395
I 93080
know 94946
by 96241
many 97249
expressions 100096
uttered 100252
by 101517
Burnside 104600
during 107582
those 109799
days 115452
and 116306
afterward 117896
that 128502
though 130751
he 134699
was 134758
deeply 135310
grieved 137069
at 141786
some 142418
things 147828
which 161040
had 161433
occurred 163436
he 165953
did 167338
not 167523
waver 168188
in 170061
his 173835
loyal 174849
friendship 177160
to 181084
McClellan 181394
He 24282
uttered 25952
no 37458
unkind 43470
word 76818
in 96922
regard 99540
to 102757
him 117208
personally 117254
either 28731
then 46506
or 103895
ever 41626
in 7260
my 161532
hearing 85583
He 85668
sometimes 169935
spoke 72808
of 127000
what 139113
he 153232
believed 270
to 54485
be 123286
mischievous 131280
influences 156431
about 175095
McClellan 176585
and 179501
which 102237
he 151644
thought 151560
were 22970
too 153269
powerful 32
with 52788
him 183412
but 94919
was 159813
earnest 4375
and 5313
consistent 17476
in 26957
wishing 27712
for 34241
him 34347
the 35224
permanent 43028
command 45685
of 46900
that 49764
army 53311
till 53593
success 56499
should 61054
give 63227
a 65612
glorious 66678
end 80808
to 83872
the 84612
war 86481
It 89347
was 89379
after 90492
the 98972
irritating 99068
incidents 100172
I 102295
have 117792
narrated 118567
that 123568
the 123808
visit 124773
to 127018
McClellan 136517
to 141953
dine 144215
with 144665
him 145021
occurred 146253
and 154266
I 157341
saw 159787
them 160086
frequently 161079
together 161085
till 161268
I 161828
left 170834
the 1059
army 29134
on 26857
the 42070
5th 64522
of 83986
October 118404
Their 142849
manner 146757
toward 149442
each 162302
other 171359
was 25808
more 107122
than 141701
cordial 2630
it 147679
was 907
affectionately 16267
intimate 21259
Burnside 28913
never 44359
mentioned 49992
to 65070
me 73547
although 74861
I 110486
was 113175
next 114681
him 126845
in 137706
command 146709
the 147109
reprimand 148418
which 149687
is 151633
copied 170081
above 171327
His 3053
real 163448
unwillingness 2765
to 152799
supersede 21124
McClellan 33811
even 100160
when 106393
the 109647
final 126893
order 136801
came 157814
in 170106
November 170430
is 171520
abundantly 179556
attested 10759
McClellan 20303
only 25774
by 65807
degrees 67305
gave 67429
outward 69024
evidence 87886
of 127660
the 129327
souring 138713
of 166215
his 37019
own 157918
feelings 161766
toward 163775
Burnside 178891
but 22998
his 74915
private 118482
letters 171452
show 175396
that 58157
the 62633
process 87931
began 22489
with 42977
the 69573
battle 89526
of 100902
South 108665
Mountain 109632
By 75040
the 96697
time 168920
that 24682
he 127529
wrote 127403
his 70139
final 149903
report 33365
in 41083
the 57938
latter 72774
part 73466
of 73587
it 100877
had 106401
advanced 116979
far 125144
enough 175278
to 16816
warp 33727
his 36742
memory 49677
of 58848
the 60350
campaign 68662
and 68816
to 71798
make 73013
him 74879
try 79263
to 87269
transfer 106997
to 110083
Burnside 132420
the 132501
responsibility 165991
for 175092
some 52380
of 53395
his 133327
mishaps 142887
When 2085
his 111448
Own 5357
Story 16146
was 52149
written 73303
the 79194
process 99213
was 106303
complete 107728
and 175002
no 35984
kindly 162585
remembrance 181949
dictated 46432
a 161801
word 20170
which 2332
could 2347
give 18153
any 20258
indication 20882
of 20955
the 21747
friendship 22130
that 25703
had 25757
died 28336
Those 28768
who 33401
are 33953
not 34028
familiar 34203
with 34451
the 36709
customs 37404
of 37837
military 41415
service 47757
might 49801
see 49924
little 50003
significance 50500
in 68957
the 72453
fact 73854
that 76444
the 78837
fault-finding 80035
with 80501
Burnside 80795
was 80818
put 80886
in 81201
the 92476
form 95634
of 98715
official 99655
communications 99675
which 100137
thus 100166
became 101796
part 107033
of 109597
the 110068
permanent 111161
documentary 112004
history 117563
of 117836
the 118337
war 131016
To 131031
military 132226
men 132278
however 132404
it 132583
would 132779
be 133084
almost 133121
conclusive 133220
proof 133484
of 133998
a 134636
settled 135443
hostility 136521
to 136821
him 137886
formally 138027

his 138280
military 138742
character 139674
in 148280
question 148282
in 155278

tell 165847
against 165934
him 166332
for 173525
ulterior 178037
purposes 178472
Nothing 178993
is 895
more 16255
common 1039
in 29114
an 2401
active 131085
campaign 965
than 21800
for 2110
a 111473
commanding 17133
officer 21154
to 25621
send 25765
messages 26372
hurrying 31068
the 33874
movement 35511
of 35543
a 36726
part 37720
of 38141
his 39811
army 40822
These 67143

usually 77885

and 95883
even 98411
when 101767

cordial 20565

exists 33321
still 33806
more 34329
delicate 36165

To 52171

such 131196
deliberate 132866

as 136895
were 154142
McClellan's 155862
during 161029
those 166060

would 169267
be 170098
scarcely 170157
conceivable 170194

a 184027
formal 184444
breach 2943
of 163338
personal 3077

it 163354

the 154612
ordinary 88202
reply 154964

McClellan's 53638

it 111139
is 111283
simply 111796
incredible 118984

the 20221

I 122738
will 122785
say 168515
a 171773
few 12672
words 23851
regarding 74875
Burnside's 122212
appearance 137573
and 141868
bearing 75052
in 132356
the 18571
field 22535
He 24618
was 37550
always 62629
a 62678
striking 69278
figure 115377
and 18717
had 62564
a 69430
dashing 69437
way 80234

him 48423
which 1321
incited 1943
enthusiasm 3752
among 9722
his 13954
soldiers 19409
Without 20092
seeming 23929
to 28086
care 28475
for 28978
his 29224
costume 29445
or 30281
even 37422
whilst 40425
affecting 48893
a 49345
little 51844
carelessness 51848
there 51968
was 53274
apt 56280
to 56380
be 56700
something 65497
picturesque 66727
about 69901
him 73332
He 76078

a 76900
hearty 79099

jovial 80280
manner 83580
a 83972
good-humored 86089
cordiality 86157
toward 87854
everybody 88553
that 88575
beamed 88766
in 90097
his 90150
face 91446
as 91574
he 91587
rode 91653
through 92037
the 92067

along 95327
the 95432
lines 95473
When 95596
not 95733
on 95798
parade 95843
he 96059
often 96094
discarded 96170
his 96182
uniform 97197
coat 97226
wearing 97255
a 97335
light 97343

his 100890

the 107141
troops 107294
which 107366
had 107703
been 107718
with 108008
him 108177
in 109003
his 109184
North 109195
Carolina 109247
campaign 109314
He 109332
wore 109574
that 109845
day 110047
a 110086
Norfolk 110122
jacket 110143
a 110334
brown 110366
knit 110540
roundabout 111544
fitting 111792
close 111850
to 111918
his 112119
person 112415
his 112417
hat 112661
was 112718
the 112765
stiff 112996
broad-rimmed 113059
high-crowned 113101
regulation 113482
hat 113600
worn 113803
rather 113823
rakishly 113830
with 114377
gold 114794
cord 115176
acorn-tipped 115252
his 115271
pistol-belt 115822
was 116214
a 116335
loose 116479
one 116649
allowing 116729
the 116879
holster 116919
to 116969
hang 117001
on 117749
his 117821
hip 117861
instead 118281
of 118283
being 119589
buckled 124027
tight 124742
about 126789
the 129311
waist 132097
his 132281
boots 132327
were 132842
the 136966
high 138080
cavalry 139367
boots 140055
reaching 141926
to 147454
the 154737
knee 156267
his 160968
large 160987
buckskin 161071
gauntlets 161472
covered 161665
his 162649
forearm 166371
he 169397
rode 172347
a 172436
large 172535
bony 172569
horse 173483
bob-tailed 173891
with 176882
a 177325
wall-eye 179377
which 179861
gave 180613
him 183136
a 184532
vicious 2007
look 111370
and 1771
suited 88660
well 121766
the 135151
brigandish 76046
air 123301
of 161499
his 173954
rider's 178347
whole 3674
appearance 121275
Burnside's 156045
flashing 58976
eyes 64199
his 69994
beard 56902
trimmed 151301
to 105847
the 96975
Burnside 156780
cut 119505
with 39130
the 46956
mustache 46987
running 47810
into 51472
the 109956
side 117600
whiskers 123137
whilst 137002
the 137963
square 139575
clean-shaven 177865
chin 113861
and 7076
jaws 37461
gave 37472
a 42736
tone 47024
of 75165
decision 82621
and 100733
force 102722
to 105149
his 105176
features 169960
made 16111
up 26947
a 32424
picture 32430
that 36426
at 43560
once 71674
arrested 149618
the 180490
eye 45598
As 170857
we 13089
went 88261
along 128175
the 946
roadside 952
at 999
a 11620
fast 12271
trot 16674
his 18316
high-stepping 18381
horse 18389
seemed 21781
to 21787
be 22662
keeping 22799
his 23212
white 23305
eye 23532
on 23665
the 23775
lookout 23949
for 24063
a 24594
chance 24836
to 24989
lash 25149
out 25196
at 25228
somebody 25256
The 25330
men 25344
evidently 25373
enjoyed 25472
the 25669
scene 25933
cheering 25966
him 26101
loudly 26151
I 26203
was 26308
particularly 26527
amused 26676
with 26807
one 33006
group 33224
of 33818
soldiers 34955
at 35582
rest 38256
by 43909
their 44182
stacked 44781
muskets 45066
They 45719
sat 45818
upon 46264
their 46371
haunches 46541
and 46749
clapped 47831
their 48059
hands 48458
as 49085
he 55663
passed 76383
exclaiming 81912
and 91513
laughing 91690
Just 92406
see 99981
the 101130
old 101143
fellow 114209
just 118112
look 124043
at 124978
him 126803
Burnside 131990
laughed 132272
at 132302
their 132396
fun 132547
as 132620
jollily 132824
as 135587
they 136550
did 136574
themselves 137413
and 137762
took 137823
no 137861
offence 137955
at 137966
the 137999
free-and-easy 138006
way 138041
in 138084
which 138269
they 138531
showed 138563
their 138597
liking 139189
for 139220
him 140602
There 148342
was 148356
no 151447
affectation 164146
in 165915
all 165964
this 166302
but 166437
an 166489
honest 166564
enjoyment 166629
in 166647
following 166725
his 167016
own 167322
whim 167803
in 167818
style 167839
and 167970
in 168070
accoutrement 168601
His 168854
sincere 169439
earnestness 171988
in 3011
the 163406
cause 866
for 16226
which 17926
he 22950
was 23480
fighting 29220
was 29518
apparent 30027
to 30174
all 48145
who 49388
met 50264
him 63491
and 67243
no 76321
one 77417
in 136247
his 179798
presence 16458
could 18084
question 18400
the 18433
single-hearted 18557
honesty 19310
and 19405
unselfishness 19515
of 19565
the 19671
man 20042
His 20113
bearing 20189
under 20539
fire 20650
was 21045
good 23039
and 23804
his 25207
personal 25934
courage 25977
beyond 28574
question 29270
He 29408
shrank 29939
from 30052
responsibility 30218
with 30313
sincere 30343
modesty 30444
because 30877
he 32193
questioned 32242
his 32324
own 32334
capacity 33077
to 33150
deal 33307
with 33335
affairs 33346
of 33666
great 33763
magnitude 34274
He 35210
was 35458
not 35568
only 37441
not 37740
ambitious 39820
to 39963
command 40471
a 40540
great 41180
army 43207
but 43296
he 43371
honestly 43949
sought 45108
to 45333
put 45389
it 45491
aside 46167
when 46859
it 46925
was 46959
thrust 47002
upon 47176
him 47187
and 47455
accepted 47472
it 47681
at 48591
last 48713
from 48999
a 49124
sense 49352
of 49416
obligation 49564
to 49968
the 53712
administration 60721
which 66005
had 67115
nominated 68740
him 68964
to 69004
it 69742
in 71132
spite 71162
of 71187
his 71360
repeated 71991
disclaimers 72000
It 72085
carafe 72371
to 72409
him 72530
finally 72565
without 72594
consulting 72731
him 72854
as 73038
a 73100
military 74303
order 79691
he 80152
could 80181
not 81727
disobey 82611
without 82953
causing 83261
a 88745

it 107809
is 113683
the 113870
unexpected 124971
that 131657
happens 136707
On 138519
the 138543
4th 138612
of 150070
October 157983
my 167166
permanent 167189
connection 167413
with 167790
the 168032
Army 173406
of 173973
the 174394
Potomac 174468
seemed 174512
assured 179523
I 179590
was 180382
in 180448
command 181154
of 3239
the 175974
Ninth 45952
Corps 78591
encamped 88971
in 89253
Pleasant 90313
Valley 94453
awaiting 130706
the 67063
renewal 67097
of 102782
active 113972
operations 141415
My 105904
promotion 13408
to 91278
the 13146
rank 29985
of 45411
Major-General 46346
had 72675
been 105522
recommended 105565
by 106535
McClellan 106537
and 29239
Burnside 30037
with 30057
the 30245
assurance 48795
that 49169
the 98376
permanent 105588
command 106491
of 107039
the 107772
corps 108673
would 29459
be 49187
added 98172
On 98319
that 106407
evening 109564
an 15388
order 15484
came 25659
from 38067
Washington 39609
directing 43341
me 45848
to 45912
return 46040
to 46220
the 51977
Kanawha 63061
valley 76997
from 79753
which 79831
our 81074
troops 81232
had 81891
been 82593
driven 82634
I 82740
was 82818
to 82910
report 90592
in 91658
person 91759
at 91827
Washington 93756
immediately 94351
and 94457
would 94646
there 100631
get 103552
detailed 103579
directions 111749
The 112069
order 118920
was 130469
as 130630
much 178690
a 67072
surprise 91670
to 105795
my 108065
immediate 17715
superiors 21517
as 86845
it 137683
was 169373
to 15276
me 89329
and 89396
apparently 181869
as 4761
little 30997
welcome 30082
We 80164
all 100976
recognized 105052
the 117220
necessity 174159
of 176310
sending 58052
some 23671
one 89807
to 92164
the 992
Kanawha 29067
who 52654
knew 66770
the 70324
country 168935
and 29892
the 79630
reasonableness 6432
therefore 8486
of 8511
assigning 12826
the 30049
duty 30197
to 30387
me 39312
McClellan 39371
and 49529
Burnside 53424
both 60342
promised 98053
that 109230
when 116141
matters 120557
should 134049
be 135174
restored 149357
to 120253
a 120303
good 56418
footing 117795
in 139955
West 29980
Virginia 30028
they 30133
would 42240
co-operate 42691
in 74996
an 108069
effort 108834
to 111943
bring 135254
me 169984
back 59029
and 85102
as 124174
this 144794
was 8322
coupled 11314
with 12035
a 13421
strong 18431
request 19578
to 20622
the 22709
War 24409
Department 26084
that 30134
my 30822
promotion 31507

self-possession 68386
of 68406
the 68892
commanding 69207
officer 70719
In 71407
this 71519
way 72492
it 72698
was 72728
one 73829
of 74465
the 74473
causes 75125
of 78839
the 78933
precipitate 79879
retreat 81662
Several 84371
circumstances 87000
combined 87112
to 87524
make 88907
Lightburn's 88944
disaster 91438
embarrassing 92411
to 93749
the 97063
government 97202
West 97220
Virginia 97604
had 97956
not 98102
been 98443
connected 99091
with 99124
any 99133
military 102310
department 105493
after 106275
Pope's 106639
command 106661
had 107360
been 107407
broken 108267
up 108563
McClellan's 109743
authority 109791
did 110925
not 111800
extend 113564
beyond 113576
his 114637
own 115205
army 115835
and 115885
its 115894
theatre 116971
of 117435
operations 117576
Halleck 118030
could 122111
hardly 124921
take 125014
personal 127299
charge 127319
of 127463
the 127998
affairs 128577
of 129182
remote 131049
districts 131814
Thus 131884
the 133540
Kanawha 133836
valley 133898
had 133920
dropped 134738
out 135582
of 135674
the 135718
usual 136060
system 136596
and 136772
was 136980
an 137125
omitted 137268
case 137726
The 138122
embarrassment 139061
was 139091
increased 141660
by 142204
the 143601
fact 145391
that 146698
Buell 149744
was 150209
retreating 150814
out 151809
of 151924
Tennessee 152146
before 153411
Bragg 154117
Morgan 155533
had 156255
evacuated 156420
Cumberland 157644
Gap 158189
and 158204
was 158640
making 158694
a 158794
painful 159104
and 159248
hazardous 159257
retreat 159625
to 159725
the 159965
Ohio 160465
and 160782
the 162193
Confederate 163091
forces 164392
under 164416
Kirby 165077
Smith 165457
were 166180
moving 166637
directly 167468
upon 167815
Cincinnati 167882
Lightburn's 168550
mishap 168872
therefore 170482
was 170552
only 172621
the 173304
northern 173593
extremity 173714
of 173837
a 175960

a 116030
territorial 144527
district 162447

details 59798

my 41566
experience 183184
there 14756

concluded 29993

saying 37418
that 37683

sent 78654

make 94911
the 95278

My 101145
task 44084
would 48238
then 98038
be 116489

enemy 84789

the 145898

that 163552

accomplished 9176
part 8302

the 131993

probably 172269
be 64616
withdrawn 41857
The 24615
actual 24626
position 26260
of 100864
Milroy's 114092

have 70902
it 70914
sent 71726

Clarksburg 79575
This 79626
gave 89637
me 96044
the 106156
opportunity 106254
to 117314
urge 105221
that 107036
my 182398
own 12089
Kanawha 78468
division 143248
be 159063
detached 7504
from 13972
the 67214
Ninth 24405
Corps 10727
and 96824
sent 135801
back 54205
to 89246
Clarksburg 88265
where 33835
with 35980
Milroy 36190
they 51676
would 106077
make 107919
a 60242
force 136352
strong 24032
enough 44072
to 48760
take 64770
care 165452
of 5925
that 15122
part 25564
of 27678
the 38573
State 43399

His 29012

different 31673

the 32614

marked 82623

modesty 116388
If 119337

with 5960
my 8472
personal 13776
staff 14463
reached 18552
Portland 29216
in 29559
the 29768
afternoon 31619
Morgan's 33073
division 39517
was 42758
found 48703
to 50562
be 53699
in 56284
quite 58822
as 62147
bad 68702
condition 76708
as 82361
had 84821
been 85199
reported 85449
but 90248
he 91835
was 113864
in 116114
daily 124121
expectation 124134
of 128808
the 134389
new 142296
equipments 143238
and 144432
clothing 144441
as 154559
well 159452
as 164698
wagons 180633
for 91611
his 105895
baggage-train 7480
and 24642
fresh 56081
horses 56231
for 63645
his 63837
artillery 63851
It 65105
was 111047
stated 60877
also 174689
that 63919
a 61943
paymaster 77262
had 6375
been 20829
ordered 51615
to 54493
join 56054
the 121513
division 130372
with 152483
funds 155321
to 169148
pay 48546
part 103270
at 26237
least 65831
of 117952
the 138162
large 10775
arrears 30832
of 33640
pay 41050
due 55268
to 55713
the 60984
men 61858
This 63442
looked 71427
hopeful 81507
but 84983
still 86380
implied 87789
some 88268
further 93577
delay 96430
Uneasy 99131
to 100767

of 112196
affairs 116757
with 118945
Lightburn's 119030

I 119782
determined 122017
to 129497
reach 129660
Gallipolis 131363
the 145133
same 147551

Our 150365
horses 162176
had 166886
been 174101
left 179855
behind 180958
and 89024
being 119419
thus 126551
dismounted 126594
we 126607
took 130829
passage 130879
in 134036
a 175198
four-horse 4956
hack 38583
a 89083
square 121999
wagon 128397
on 140193
springs 44387
enclosed 536

rubber-cloth 14298

Night 29385
fell 32340
soon 36946
after 46983
we 48082
began 49812
our 50353
journey 51432

pushing 60057
on 65409
in 67625
the 75158

the 91103

blundered 99940

upset 105097
us 111027
off 117708
the 118781
end 127678
of 144618
a 165922

sluiceway 130855
bridge 89839
into 146959
a 152309
mud-hole 176108
He 87540
managed 128449
to 60336
jump 60389
from 120438
his 7541
seat 83412
and 7091
hold 183754
his 185029
team 185410
but 185424
there 3679
was 8146
no 36036
help 50172
for 119211
us 153939
who 5017
were 35290
buttoned 61339
in 140548
The 140625
mud 166542
was 1609
soft 2886
and 2896
deep 4987
and 6503
as 10525
the 11910
wagon 14781
settled 17281
on 20864
its 25068
side 29896
we 31120
were 32654
tumbled 33468
in 34342
a 37585
promiscuous 42439
heap 42653
into 42837
the 45189
ooze 45251
and 47031
slime 52748
which 54031
completely 54197
covered 56310
us 63273
We 63947
were 64991
not 65112
long 67633
in 70860
climbing 73978
out 74962
and 78195

it 109707
As 110164
we 110363
came 111710
into 111904

on 170525
the 174693

were 179662
certainly 2494
as 140410
sorry 3091
a 169597
military 63846
spectacle 5286
as 12857
could 14161
be 15499
imagined 18705
We 20674
were 20942
most 33354
kindly 33751
received 34015

men 43965
taking 48098

whilst 106875
we 107101
stood 114000
before 116343
the 116741
fire 126749
and 143650
scraped 144835
the 145232
thick 145538
mud 146226
from 161606
our 168585
uniforms 169457
with 22001
chips 94796
from 138105
the 138155

making 92240
rather 6280
boisterous 23326
sport 18586

our 159858
mishap 41974
Before 48086
the 67250
wagon 77011
had 101606
been 109123
righted 163977
and 168455
partly 173674
cleaned 173900
we 174613
had 173751
scraped 10138
and 16195
sponged 48416
each 64540
other 70119

and 147347
were 158000
ready 164646
to 62169
go 112579
on 83372
We 143099
noticed 9238
however 24530
that 25716
the 46587
room 55644
had 43797
filled 84006
with 20344
men 31870
women 51362
and 58408
children 65330
from 65514
the 79329
neighborhood 126484
who 32025
stood 96980
bashfully 8093
back 167572
in 14767
the 14508
shadows 33527
and 35594
who 41073
modestly 43693
explained 48913
that 83254
they 94586
had 98357
heard 99638
there 132430
was 152668
a 164999
live 167437
general 168049
there 168482
and 1815

never 20375
seen 23806
one 25445
they 26214
had 35087
come 45473
over 45811
They 72636
must 72968
have 96934
formed 103918
some 103924
amusing 105458
ideas 105609
of 106472
military 114875
personages 115084
and 132354
we 156921
found 142406

in 24680
being 25136

they 36575
did 40563
in 43490
visiting 49249

Our 71229
mishap 71799
made 73185
us 97478
wait 103775
for 109352
the 115386

which 165114
rose 165224
in 178752
an 181138
hour 108157
or 107811
so 113665
and 10105
we 80166
then 23723
took 109893
leave 28188
of 98780
our 98840
entertainers 182322
and 30986
our 91214
audience 24036
and 18538
drove 32271
on 46249
with 46441
no 46530
desire 2534
however 140450
to 144388
repeat 146307
the 107851
performance 11629
We 123944

ten 152959
miles 53522
more 52566
of 53938
the 65184

found 4208
it 54320

rough 119458
and 119554
our 120049
progress 120811
so 16325
slow 54442

we 54600
were 54631
glad 56130

Footnote 110573
Ante 17292
p 24458
that 29197
Mr 48465
George 139215
Summers 67283
formerly 105916
the 132299
leading 174520
man 97509
of 90415
the 106478
valley 116645
had 3705
studiously 12893
avoided 28269
political 44402
activity 82071
after 46293
the 30972
war 106059
began 117002
but 118147
this 4916
did 53739
not 56599
save 150851
him 175737
from 30511
the 31763
hostility 8718
of 75689
his 151433
disloyal 165285
neighbors 2692
Very 147741
shortly 4046
after 8650
my 52632
re-occupation 52955
of 54554
Charleston 70280
he 151526
called 151894
upon 153656
me 153861
one 154288
evening 156605
and 48599
asked 184760
for 5341
a 8894
private 13630
interview 16137
He 37196
had 61983
gone 70190
through 81308
a 89500
painful 119076
experience 119456
he 120034
said 121537
and 126272
as 133186
it 135851
would 139258
pretty 146418
surely 146518
come 146727
to 147334
my 147472
ears 149778
he 152960
preferred 157482
I 172983
should 174425
hear 2583
it 140499
from 27812
himself 39478
before 76797
enemies 140765
or 142473
tale-bearers 150641
should 151302
present 151994
it 166960
with 173352
such 51376
coloring 80597
as 124228
they 124593
might 11327
choose 101338
During 60659
the 8072
Confederate 9232
occupation 9234
he 39217
had 50176
maintained 73991
his 9172
secluded 84507
life 84537
and 181457
kept 31123
aloof 57881
from 57958
contact 61821
with 63632
the 63870
military 2177
authorities 5657
Their 7313
officers 9737
however 12921
summoned 12933
him 57833
before 58298
them 60893
charged 61393
him 61689
with 61716
treason 61944
to 64788
Virginia 111069
and 118866
to 92057
the 139958
Confederate 9255
States 780
and 857
demanded 1650
of 3355
him 3908
that 6382
he 6708
take 7466
the 8553
oath 8819
of 9002
allegiance 9787
to 11031
the 12393
Southern 12447
government 13156
He 14230
demurred 15579
to 16217
this 18288
and 20653
urged 22035
that 25247
as 27128
he 27166
had 31397
scrupulously 35865
avoided 35975
public 36095
activity 36240
it 40326
would 41206
be 44295
harsh 44564
and 45236
unjust 45596
to 47606
force 48389
him 48653
to 49043
a 49230
test 50709
which 50786
he 53042
could 53386
not 58740
conscientiously 60328
take 69744
They 71672
were 71929
in 72426
no 73163
mood 75220
to 75274
listen 75598
to 76249
argument 77304
and 78492
charged 81021
that 81667
his 83738
acquiescence 83863
in 87334
the 87730
rule 88074
of 89218
the 92826
new 96717
state 97272
government 97609
of 100216
West 102077
Virginia 102389
was 102515
in 103179
his 103836
case 112864
more 115222
injurious 116587
to 117143
the 118166
Confederate 118239

Finding 127047
Mr 127836
Summers 131675
disposed 133167
to 133544
be 133588
firm 133935
they 139844
held 139884
him 140936
in 143059
arrest 145447
and 146925
as 149556
he 151137
still 157183
refused 157314
to 157467
yield 158727
he 160861
was 161752
told 162786
that 166761

should 167177
be 170742
tied 170846
by 172226
a 173132
rope 173733
to 176512
the 178039
tail 179786

a 2091

forced 10439
to 11021

a 17635

over 26813
the 28020

He 50980
was 54957
an 55705
elderly 55834

used 61651

easy 70099

somewhat 78644
portly 78722
in 79394
person 82769
and 83758
as 84792
he 86509
said 89726
he 90782
fully 92115

manner 111179
convinced 111454
him 115514
that 117514
they 118386
meant 120462
to 123897
execute 128527
the 128778
threat 128841
and 130344
looking 132531
upon 132636
it 133359
as 138262
a 140149
sentence 140280
of 141259
death 141998
he 143328
yielded 143454
and 143901
took 145097
the 149179
oath 149998
He 150201
said 153522
that 155784
being 164276
in 165278
duress 171207
of 171964
such 171997
a 177886
sort 178901
and 180640
himself 181424
a 115409
lawyer 185154
he 3984
considered 6177
that 9389
he 9600
had 11615
a 33939
moral 42963
right 45570
to 49585
escape 71707
from 75261
his 81941
captors 86615
in 88875
this 90625
way 92330
though 116396
he 116600
would 119851
not 120305
have 122025
yielded 122963
to 132548
anything 135111
short 136748
of 147382
what 161848
seemed 181327
to 21230
him 139790
an 13507
imminent 16120
danger 59594
of 11733
his 40754
life 42997
The 141620
obligation 81544
he 119806
declared 120311
was 120490
utterly 122347
odious 122386
to 140731
him 5143
and 30944
was 31025
not 39338
binding 50018
on 90369
his 123170
conscience 44389
but 45457
he 61098
had 120546
lost 122367
no 9535
time 38958
in 116693
putting 135792
himself 93359
into 169534
my 40652
hands 20901
and 37486
would 13468
submit 39466
to 44383
whatever 44509
I 90064
should 108950
decide 167846
in 44870
the 67355
matter 6073
It 6450
would 7630
be 13371
humiliating 21247
and 28279
subject 33051
him 33214
to 39643
misconstruction 52300
by 57735
others 65013
if 66297
he 68287
took 71868
conflicting 86692
oaths 87799
but 91180
he 105287
was 113619
willing 114427
to 114485
abjure 115736
the 124429
obligation 133853
he 135328
had 137681
taken 138539
if 139106
I 149252
demanded 150001
it 158453
and 162917
would 165623
voluntarily 167158
renew 176023
his 2363
allegiance 131047
to 100429
the 161319
United 11998
States 63399
with 75655
full 51377
purpose 60545
to 61658
keep 64939
it 84377
He 84849
was 124594
deeply 29924
agitated 55697
and 90310
I 146887
thoroughly 183946
pitied 184923
him 184936
My 184959
acquaintance 185120
with 185255
him 183894
in 64732
my 14483
former 60592
campaign 10315
gave 38726
me 60705
entire 60417
confidence 11405
in 79325
his 84432
sincerity 19648
and 43081
made 46935
me 46984
wish 47125
to 67538
spare 135013
him 67317
any 67370
fresh 26043
embarrassment 29636
or 41995
pain 44140
After 55782
a 62708
moment's 67377
reflection 77317
I 78185
replied 84794
that 134662
I 136405
did 174459
not 172383
doubt 61535
anything 63617
he 65511
had 49908
told 141577
me 167575
of 22871
the 87716
facts 3577
or 12750
of 20463
his 44971
own 45579
sentiments 45618
in 46645
regard 71571
to 71842
them 72262
His 73369
experience 74850
only 75475
confirmed 76242
my 77023
distrust 78271
of 166877
all 172513
test 172704
oaths 174222
Either 174916
his 177566
conscience 1173
already 44685
bound 1475
him 65781
to 9352
the 16615
National 20765
government 27211
or 28847
it 76120
did 76357
not 80745
In 93629
either 125669
case 126831
I 127357
could 139039
not 139499
make 154508
his 156389
loyalty 159398
more 159520
sure 159586
by 161630
a 161813
fresh 171149
oath 172597
and 175747
believing 78020
that 172640
the 3780
one 17150
he 28326
had 81313
taken 83025
under 123047
duress 159234
was 166679
void 171177
in 179213
fact 179673
as 180104
well 159467
as 171592
in 80002
his 8697
own 14937
conscience 55143
I 64309
would 84585
leave 84908
the 85936
matter 90868
there 92130
and 115411
ask 120200
nothing 120408
more 126791
of 130076
him 135908
He 182028
was 64837
greatly 87006
relieved 148484
by 154414
my 168716
decision 61779
but 85081
bore 111019
himself 122163
with 164768
dignity 8667
I 11547
never 11944
saw 52845
any 54538
reason 65031
to 153081
be 46071
sorry 54939
for 121641
the 171657
course 41738
I 39506
took 10959
and 47732
believe 82321
that 87057
he 87916
was 87940
always 88820
afterward 99801
consistent 142436
and 169045
steady 181926
in 16171
his 47635
loyalty 60772
to 91018

Early 172951
in 46

I 27964
established 28863
my 61403

headquarters 121853
at 152157
Marietta 152371
on 153141
the 153822
Ohio 169389

a 182873
central 182893
position 182943
from 183000
which 183025
communication 183051
could 183192
be 183212

was 9707
thus 9804
conveniently 10401
situated 10657
for 12140
most 12681
speedily 13273

little 23909
while 24215
to 26596
get 26622
affairs 27925
so 28050
organized 28267
that 28872
the 29630
routine 29894
of 30561
work 31570
ran 31871
on 32408
quietly 32809
and 34733
pleasantly 34893
No 34981
serious 35499
effort 35531
was 36417
made 38433

the 39922
enemy 40151

bush-whacking 48417
and 49201
petty 50020
guerilla 52094
warfare 53031
there 55053
was 56320
nothing 56659
to 56891
interrupt 57410
the 57638
progress 58164
of 58207
the 58436
troops 58464
in 58876

instruction 59925
A 59964
good 60016
deal 60439
of 60516
obscurity 60567
still 60634
hangs 60745
about 62026
the 62304
subject 62473
of 62670
guerilla 63264
warfare 63411
and 64117
the 64135
relation 64498
of 64881
the 64917
Confederate 64937
government 66314
to 67368
it 70145
There 70579
was 71116
no 71936
doubt 72681
a 73142
good 74262
deal 74488
of 75810
loose 79467
talk 81440
that 83050
found 83070
its 84392
way 84861
into 85274
print 85502
and 86318
helped 86411
form 89400
a 89644
popular 91528
opinion 92112
which 93262
treated 93710
almost 94184
every 96538
scouting 96566
party 96643
as 96801
if 98778
it 99300
were 101323
a 102060
lawless 102356
organization 102825
of 103324
bush-whackers 104061
But 104427
there 105950
was 106136
an 106963
authoritative 107536
and 108426
systematic 108610
effort 109550
of 110244
the 110838
Richmond 110989
government 111048
to 111583
keep 112477
up 113126
partisan 113373
bodies 113463
within 113492
our 114728

when 118893
they 119795
had 120926
a 121108
chance 121125
to 122312
do 122487
us 122681
a 123838
mischief 123860
and 124259

that 84366
his 84386
was 84407
the 84433
best 84470
of 84478
the 84502
lot 84590
we 84851
may 84878
imagine 85029
what 85041
must 85167
have 85232
been 85376
the 85397
character 85453
of 85548
the 85581
rest 85606
In 85653
the 85801
first 85831
two 85854
winters 85960
of 86045
the 86092
war 86118
these 86130
organizations 86175
were 86277
in 86399
the 86412
height 86417
of 86434
their 86493
pernicious 86552
activity 86654
and 86834
the 86974
loyal 87032
West 87043
Virginians 87053
were 87095
their 87117
favorite 87192
victims 87254
We 87267
knew 87272
almost 87280
nothing 87305
of 87312
their 87382
organization 87616
except 87629
that 87637
they 87653
claimed 87669
some 87800
Confederate 87867
law 88020
for 88070
their 88108
being 88113
We 88190
seldom 88216
found 88273
them 88299
in 88308
uniform 88313
and 88416
had 88444
no 88778
means 88790
of 89159
distinguishing 89181
them 89298
from 89381
any 89523
other 89549
armed 89684
horse-stealers 89811
and 89868
bush-whackers 89904
We 89975
were 90156
however 90228
made 90237
unpleasantly 90351
certain 90463
of 90500
the 90697
fact 90728
that 90798
in 90835
every 90880
neighborhood 90913
where 90944
secession 90958
sentiments 91079
were 91162
rife 91184
our 91265
messengers 91271
were 91332
waylaid 91337
and 91396
killed 91455
small 91529
parties 92174
were 92208
ambushed 92622
and 92816
all 92875
the 93367
exasperating 93378
forms 93482
of 93511
guerilla 93633
warfare 93717
were 93810
abundant 93820
Besides 93832
all 93882
this 93967
the 93995
Confederate 94005
authorities 94022
assumed 94033
to 94046
call 94069
out 94082
the 94203
militia 94232
of 94468
counties 94506
into 94547
which 94675
they 94679
were 94693
intending 94731
to 94737
make 94775
an 94800
expedition 94944
so 95019
that 95443
they 95557
might 96077
have 96319
the 96336
temporary 96407
co-operation 96432
of 96499
local 96539
troops 96710
They 96738
claimed 96872
the 96880
right 96956
to 97077
do 97097
this 97115
because 97138
they 97218
had 97567
not 97758
recognized 97800
the 97830
separation 97926
of 98000
West 98093
Virginia 98125
and 98311
insisted 98386
that 98488
the 98648
whole 98691
was 98728
subject 98867
to 98875
the 98952
laws 98991
of 99003
Virginia 99033
The 99053
result 99065
was 99071
that 99186
the 99202
Union 99231
men 99262
formed 99265
companies 99292
of 99312
Home 99338
Guards 99355
for 99371
self-protection 99408
and 99606
the 99712
conflict 99744
of 99828
arms 99837
was 99860
carried 99889
into 99955
every 100122
settlement 100130
in 100209
the 100235
mountain 100242
nooks 100254
and 100269
along 100280
the 100283
valleys 100551
In 100870
this 101367
kind 101376
of 101457
fighting 101550
there 101648
was 101669
no 101886
quarter 101898
given 101957
or 101982
if 102023
prisoners 102053
were 102067
taken 102086
they 102102
were 102354
too 103189
often 103224
reported 103316
as 103333
having 103388
met 103424
with 103466
fatal 103508
accidents 103542
before 103559
they 103566
could 103644
be 103826
handed 104134
over 104263
to 104481
the 104489
regular 104495
authorities 104501
As 104546
all 104611
this 104612
could 104674
have 104693
no 104721
effect 104939
upon 104982
the 105089
progress 105264
of 105282
the 105411
war 105591
the 105755
more 105767
cool 105789
and 106028
intelligent 106207
heads 106285
of 106565
both 107021
sides 107090
opposed 107230
it 107402
and 107513
gradually 107562
diminished 107613
it 107695
Severe 107783
measures 107790
against 107878
it 108215
were 108344
in 108394
fact 108422
merciful 108431
for 108450
the 108604
horrors 108632
of 108664
war 108687
are 108691
always 108781
least 108812
when 108825
the 108843
fighting 108897
is 108970
left 109678
to 109736
the 109750
armies 109801
of 110050
responsible 110101
belligerents 110137
unprovoked 110149
by 110188
the 110238
petty 110266
but 110355
exasperating 110371
hostilities 110378
of 110508
irregulars 110756
The 110784
trouble 110796
from 110825
this 111049
source 111118
was 111314
less 111332
during 111480
the 111497
winter 111673
of 111870
than 112030
it 112175
had 112324
been 112503
the 112516
year 112610
before 112664
but 112699
it 112776
still 113071
gave 113257
occupation 113320
to 113364
small 113383
movable 113393
columns 113539
of 113617
our 113780
troops 113792
from 113919
time 114123
to 114242
time 114339
The 114386
organization 114397
of 114400
my 114461
staff 114471
was 114553
somewhat 114566

returned 115826
to 115853
me 115890

inspector-general 115962

at 118255
the 118267
same 118371

with 118428

admirable 120981

the 121088

associated 121204
with 121237
late 121256
in 121270

war 121667
Three 121773
principal 121811

were 121951
established 121993

Major 128988

in 129502
a 129528
rare 129534
measure 129564
There 129571
was 129620

slight 130559
skirmishes 130695

these 131275
did 131311
not 131397
prevent 131421
our 131482

An 138037

a 138413
hot 138533

the 8315

the 9058
second 9076

he 9082
replied 9085
that 9088
It 9091
is 9126
believed 9130
by 9134
this 9165
Department 9167
that 9178
the 9199
law 9209
authorizing 9214

of 9273
the 9280
volunteer 9304

militia 9333
forces 9364
necessarily 9367
implied 9375
an 9386
increase 9430
of 9436
officers 9445
beyond 9460
the 9478
number 9484
specified 9493
in 9519
the 9523
Act 9529
of 9554
July 9559
to 9571
any 9579
extent 9582
required 9589
by 9614
the 9618
service 9621
and 9630
that 9633
the 9637
number 9644
of 9675
appointments 9686
is 9711
not 9749
beyond 9752
such 9756
limit 9771
If 9805
the 9815

the 9902

one 11004

omitted 11052
so 11090
that 11097
if 11100

should 11121
prove 11147
to 11150
be 11171
the 11178
limit 11188
there 11202
would 11209
be 11215
thirteen 11223
in 11242
excess 11253
This 11269
however 11280
was 11291
only 11304
apparently 11320
true 11344
for 11347
the 11397
Secretary's 11400
list 11412
included 11418
the 11434
four 11442
major-generals 11459
in 11462
the 11474
regular 11479

covered 11571
by 11593
the 11616
limitation 11619
of 11623
the 11636
statute 11641
This 11647
seems 11681
to 11690
have 11695
been 11711
overlooked 11765
in 11783
the 11787
steps 11794
subsequently 11797
taken 11826
by 11848
members 11858
of 11878
Congress 11888
and 11903
as 11906
the 11913
action 11923
was 11946
unwelcome 11962
to 11968
the 11971
President 11983
he 11991
did 12029
not 12056
enlighten 12060
the 12063
legislators 12101
respecting 12114
their 12143
miscalculation 12150
The 12153
business 12158
proceeded 12182
upon 12196
the 12204
supposition 12207
that 12226
the 12241
appointments 12250
in 12260
the 12264
highest 12267
rank 12270
were 12282

in 12300
excess 12306

year 12905
authorized 12913
a 12925
second 12931
call 12953
of 12972
the 12991
same 13004
number 13030

such 13096
number 13110

the 13341

however 13360
a 13370
rider 13376

put 13412
upon 13420
the 13425

date 14427

in 14453
the 14562
Secretary's 14589

seems 14681
to 14690
be 14717
a 14722
misprint 14732
This 14738
limit 14772
just 14775
covered 14790
those 14794
who 14812
had 14822
been 14831
appointed 14839
up 14847

Two 15001
questions 15004
however 15039
were 15069
still 15085
open 15092
for 15110
dispute 15117
First 15121
whether 15138
a 15147
rider 15150
upon 15158
the 15166
appropriation 15174
should 15177
change 15192
a 15220
general 15238
law 15244
on 15248
the 15268
subject 15271
of 15274
army 15281
organization 15284
and 15288
second 15297
whether 15308
the 15318
new 15322
limit 15329
might 15332
not 15335
allow 15349
appointments 15373
to 15377
be 15381
thereafter 15392
made 15403
to 15415
the 15420
extent 15424
of 15427
the 15476
numbers 15496
stated 15511
The 15532
report 15555
of 15562
Mr 15565
Stanton 15573
evidently 15581
suggests 15583
such 15601
questions 15611
The 15619
matter 15639
was 15674
now 15691
in 15713
good 15734
shape 15752
for 15766
what 15773
politicians 15778
call 15791
a 15794
deal 15804
and 15809
negotiations 15825
between 15828
members 15843
of 15858
Congress 15889
and 15903
the 15921
executive 15948
were 15956
active 15959
The 15971
result 15976
appears 15984
to 16000
have 16028
been 16041
an 16056
understanding 16070
that 16101
a 16110
bill 16113
should 16118
be 16136
passed 16158
increasing 16167
the 16182
number 16188
of 16197
general 16200
officers 16218
so 16225
as 16234
not 16244
only 16252
to 16264
cover 16294
the 16301
appointments 16307
already 16310
made 16345
but 16378
leaving 16384
a 16394
considerable 16403
margin 16409
of 16414
new 16421
promotions 16425
to 16435
be 16445
filled 16448
by 16452
arrangement 16457
between 16475

high 16509
contracting 16520
parties 16534
On 16544
the 16558
12th 16561
of 16579
February 16594
the 16602
Senate 16616
passed 16627
a 16636
bill 16649
providing 16657
for 16667
the 16673
appointment 16676
of 16697
twenty 16716
major-generals 16743
of 16752
volunteers 16784
and 16792
fifty 16796
brigadiers 16812
This 16831
was 16843
not 16857
acceptable 16877
to 16971
the 16974
House 16985
The 16990
battle 16995
of 17018
Stone's 17038
River 17061
had 17066
lately 17101
been 17109
fought 17141
in 17144
Tennessee 17154
and 17173
representatives 17177
from 17198
the 17208
West 17217
were 17237
urgent 17268
in 17279
arguing 17288
that 17291
affairs 17299
near 17305
Washington 17312
unduly 17324
filled 17326
the 17330
view 17339
of 17356
the 17372
administration 17382
There 17386
was 17389
some 17402
truth 17406
in 17418
this 17422
At 17425
any 17428
rate 17436
the 17450
House 17458
amended 17461
the 17475
bill 17479
so 17482
as 17486
to 17496
increase 17508
the 17511
numbers 17518
to 17536
forty 17545
major-generals 17549
and 17566
one 17579
hundred 17595
brigadiers 17604
to 17619
be 17628
made 17632
by 17637
promotions 17641
for 17644
meritorious 17658
service 17680
from 17687
lower 17708
grades 17714
As 17733
soon 17736
as 17740
it 17757
was 17760
known 17771
that 17775
the 17781
Military 17784
Committee 17800
of 17821
the 17833
House 17839
would 17859
report 17868
such 17884
an 17887
amendment 17894
it 17897
was 17904
assumed 17909
that 17913
the 17916
Senate 17922
would 17928
concur 17936
and 17946
a 17949
slate 17960
was 17965
made 17969
up 17979
accordingly 17984
On 17986
the 17990
hypothesis 17997
that 18007
the 18013
list 18028
of 18031
major-generals 18048
was 18051
thirteen 18055
in 18062
excess 18065
of 18078
the 18082
forty 18098
fixed 18101
by 18105
statute 18109
a 18130
new 18164
list 18177
of 18184
twenty-seven 18188
was 18195
made 18199
out 18211
which 18215
would 18268
complete 18276
the 18291
forty 18307
to 18313
be 18318
added 18322
by 18334
the 18340
new 18344
bill 18353
A 18365
similar 18376
list 18380
was 18388
prepared 18391
for 18399
the 18409
brigadiers 18419
and 18423
precisely 18428
similar 18437
negotiations 18445
went 18461
on 18465
but 18475
for 18481
brevity's 18518
sake 18556
I 18589
shall 18618
confine 18623
myself 18640
to 18646
the 18654
list 18666
for 18674
the 18677
highest 18724
rank 18754
in 18762
which 18773
I 18777
was 18780
personally 18783
concerned 18790
The 18844
House 18876
passed 18885
the 18896
amended 18904
bill 18919
on 18926
the 18931
27th 18954
of 19010
February 19014
and 19019
it 19034
went 19050
back 19070
to 19108
the 19126
Senate 19144
for 19191
concurrence 19210
in 19226
the 19229
amendments 19235
But 19250
now 19253
an 19284
unexpected 19309
difficulty 19312
arose 19320
The 19333
Senate 19346
refused 19352
to 19369
concur 19372
in 19385
the 19392
changes 19416
made 19442
by 19483
the 19504
House 19514
It 19517
matters 19528
little 19552
whether 19559
the 19564
senators 19579
were 19583
offended 19589
at 19625
the 19646
determination 19650
of 19653
the 19657
lower 19666
House 19669
to 19689
have 19694
so 19709
large 19721
a 19744
share 19746
in 19751
the 19760
nominations 19769
or 19812
desired 19827
to 19833
punish 19837
the 19862
President 19878
for 19882
having 19909
gone 19929
beyond 19943
the 19963
letter 19973
of 19994
the 19997
law 20000
in 20009
his 20078
promotions 20095
of 20103
the 20111
fact 20118
was 20159
that 20162
they 20179
voted 20198
down 20208
the 20213
amendments 20216
A 20220
committee 20246
of 20252
conference 20294
between 20300
the 20304
two 20318
houses 20321
was 20324
appointed 20364
and 20397
a 20427
compromise 20430
report 20434
was 20437
made 20444
fixing 20448
the 20466
additional 20471
number 20475
of 20478
major-generals 20489
at 20495
thirty 20498
and 20509
of 20519
brigadiers 20528
at 20536
seventy-five 20541
Both 20564
Houses 20588
finally 20635
concurred 20639
in 20646
the 20649
report 20659
the 20677
bill 20680
went 20696
to 20718
the 20725
President 20746
on 20757
the 20761
1st 20769
of 20777
March 20795
and 20800
he 20805
signed 20809
it 20832
on 20840
the 20844
next 20849
day 20861
There 20879
was 20885
but 20889
a 20893
single 20896
working-day 20900

the 20914
session 20924
left 20938
for 20962
the 20966

at 21058
noon 21081

the 21090

of 21150
March 21156
The 21159
list 21162
must 21173
be 21178
reduced 21196
The 21202
manner 21205
in 21209
which 21215
this 21218
was 21228
done 21252
clinches 21255
the 21265
proof 21268
if 21275
there 21284
had 21333
been 21336
any 21349
doubt 21363
before 21369
that 21448
the 21463
list 21468
of 21471
twenty-seven 21502
was 21504
the 21507
result 21516
of 21521
negotiations 21525
with 21535
congressmen 21587
No 21590
meddling 21595
with 21604
that 21607
list 21612
was 21619
permitted 21629
though 21633
the 21635
use 21641
of 21647
patronage 21692
as 21721
spoils 21742
had 21755
some 21769
very 21772
glaring 21818
illustrations 21822
in 21830
it 21833
The 21843
President 21858
had 21862
to 21866
make 21891
the 21912
reduction 21928
from 21953
his 21978
own 21985
promotions 21992
made 22005
earlier 22008
and 22021
which 22043
were 22064
therefore 22067
higher 22091
on 22097
the 22107
list 22112
and 22118
in 22169
rank 22203
instead 22206
of 22213
dropping 22221
those 22252
last 22267
added 22270
as 22274
had 22277
seemed 22282
to 22287
be 22290
demanded 22299
by 22302
the 22314
earlier 22317
action 22321
of 22331
Congress 22341
The 22363
only 22368
exception 22379
to 22383
this 22386
was 22389
in 22396
the 22401
case 22410
of 22413
General 22416
Schofield 22423
whose 22426
even-handed 22435
administration 22456
of 22459
the 22464
District 22476
of 22480
Missouri 22502
and 22516
army 22519
of 22537
the 22541
frontier 22560
had 22566
excited 22595
the 22607
enmity 22611
of 22616
extreme 22624
politicians 22628
in 22656
that 22661
State 22675
and 22679
in 22686
Kansas 22692
led 22701
by 22748
Senator 22758

Lane 22808
the 22812
prince 22815
of 22824
jay-hawkers 22827
Schofield 22836
was 22848
dropped 22885
from 22890
the 22894
twenty-seven 22907
A 22915
few 22920
changes 22926
had 22944
occurred 22948
in 22958
the 22977
original 23000
roster 23018
of 23024
officers 23038
making 23054
additional 23058
vacancies 23073
Governor 23100
Morgan 23139
of 23160
New 23181
York 23193
who 23211
had 23215
a 23221
complimentary 23275
appointment 23290
as 23304
major-general 23329
but 23349
had 23364

Schuyler 23394
Hamilton 23402

resigned 23425
and 23463
Fitz-John 23468
Porter 23473
was 23476
cashiered 23486
The 23512
number 23516
to 23531
be 23535
sacrificed 23555
was 23564
thus 23574
reduced 23580
to 23616
six 23641
and 23643

fell 23669

second 23897

were 23928

at 23965
varying 23976
intervals 23983
but 23996
of 23999
that 24002
later 24008
Of 24012
course 24021
in 24031
such 24034
a 24039
scramble 24058
it 24062
was 24074
only 24079
a 24091
question 24099
as 24138
to 24173
who 24217
had 24261
or 24294
had 24339
not 24352
powerful 24367
friends 24373
on 24393
the 24400
spot 24407
who 24415
would 24419
voluntarily 24422
champion 24455
his 24476
cause 24483
No 24525
one 24532
at 24589
a 24593
distance 24607
could 24617
have 24641
any 24645
warning 24676
The 24679
passage 24683
of 24694
the 24697
bill 24703
and 24706
action 24713
under 24716
it 24764
came 24776
together 24799
For 24832
myself 24835
I 24856
had 24861
gone 24893
quietly 24896
on 24899
in 24924
the 24926
performance 24936
of 24976
duty 24988
never 24994
dreaming 25013
of 25057
danger 25059
and 25062
it 25065
was 25076
long 25082
years 25086
after 25104
the 25110
war 25116
before 25120
I 25138
learned 25144
how 25148
the 25153
thing 25195
had 25198
in 25205
fact 25217
been 25227
done 25230
My 25255
place 25283
had 25295
been 25314
near 25322
the 25325
top 25329
of 25342
the 25357
list 25360
the 25368
commands 25372
which 25380
I 25384
had 25392
exercised 25413
and 25418
the 25421
responsibilities 25443
intrusted 25451
to 25454
me 25467
had 25471
been 25476
greater 25491
than 25514
those 25533
of 25539
the 25544
large 25547
majority 25554
of 25637
the 25640
appointees 25648
and 25656
I 25664
had 25668
conclusive 25674
evidence 25677
of 25684
the 25699
approval 25707
of 25721
my 25736
superiors 25747
The 25752
news 25759
was 25767
at 25795
first 25824
therefore 25840
both 25844
astonishing 25852
and 25856
disheartening 25859
As 25869
a 25872
result 25879
of 25883
political 25892
influences 25899
it 25902
is 25919
sufficiently 25932
intelligible 25936
I 25965
had 25971
at 25981
that 25984
time 26004
a 26028
barely 26032
speaking 26047
acquaintance 26053
with 26059
Senator 26062
Wade 26073
of 26081
Ohio 26086
It 26100
was 26117
the 26145
same 26150
with 26154
Senator 26158
Sherman 26167
but 26174
with 26180
the 26202
added 26207
disadvantage 26219
that 26222
in 26226
the 26249
senatorial 26267
contest 26270
of 26303
between 26307
him 26322
and 26332
Governor 26336
Dennison 26351
I 26365
had 26374
warmly 26391
espoused 26400
the 26409
cause 26412
of 26416
the 26442
latter 26454
Mr 26470
Hutchins 26474
the 26494
representative 26505
from 26526
my 26530
district 26558
had 26578
not 26607
been 26625
renominated 26631
and 26647
Garfield 26656
who 26665
was 26669
elected 26675
in 26716
his 26722
place 26738
had 26758
not 26761
yet 26779
taken 26806
his 26814
seat 26820
but 26826
was 26830
still 26836
in 26848
the 26859
military 26863
service 26886
in 26893
the 26904
field 26911
Mr 26920
Chase 26956
had 26963
been 26973
a 26982
constant 27001
friend 27024
but 27033
this 27071
was 27102
just 27115
the 27135
time 27185
when 27193
his 27256
differences 27262
with 27270
Mr 27297
Lincoln 27308
had 27331
become 27351
acute 27376
and 27379
since 27416
the 27426
20th 27526
of 27547
December 27550
the 27629
President 27632
had 27645
in 27661
his 27674
hands 27696
the 27714
resignations 27732
of 27735
both 27780
Seward 27791
and 27839
Chase 27894
which 27937
enabled 27968
him 27974
to 27994
refuse 28000
both 28007
and 28079
to 28082
baffle 28100
the 28151
party 28153
in 28163
the 28177
Senate 28184
which 28223
was 28255
trying 28260
to 28268
force 28275
him 28278
to 28288
reorganize 28299
his 28305
cabinet 28315
by 28321
excluding 28325
Seward 28335
and 28338
those 28342
who 28409
were 28416
thought 28434
the 28437
more 28474
conservative 28485
As 28496
he 28501
expressed 28539
it 28542
he 28573
had 28592
a 28605
pumpkin 28608
in 28628
each 28647
end 28655
of 28688
his 28713

one 31440

a 31492
vacancy 31512

resigned 31698

had 31756
never 31778

The 31798

it 32259

accuracy 32285
the 32303
exact 32306
date 32310
of 32323
the 32327

which 32333
occurred 32391
Footnote 32423
The 32456
reason 32462
for 32465
this 32469
difficulty 32490
is 32505
in 32515
part 32530
found 32580
in 32590
the 32600
frequent 32622
assignment 32653
of 32666
rank 32730
to 32768
officers 32783
from 32786
an 32796
earlier 32802
date 32822
than 32826
their 32832
appointment 32847
and 32872
as 32875
the 32906
official 32949
lists 32953
are 32969
arranged 32972
according 32987
to 32996
rank 33002
they 33005
are 33010
sometimes 33026
misleading 33031
as 33050
to 33061
date 33067
of 33076
appointment 33088
Thus 33095
Rosecrans 33102
dates 33108
in 33112
the 33123
register 33126
from 33141
March 33144

he 33157

It 34487
would 34494
be 34518
unjust 34524
to 34528
assume 34534
that 34541
members 34546
of 34560
Congress 34604
and 34607
the 34613
President 34621
were 34637
not 34648
guided 34651
by 34698
patriotic 34703
motives 34711
The 34716
reform 34752
of 34758
the 34768
public 34773
service 34785
in 34799
matters 34805
of 34868
appointment 34883
had 34910
not 34914
then 34927
attracted 34947
much 34954
attention 34965
Patronage 35000
was 35003
used 35037
for 35047
political 35082
purposes 35086
with 35090
complete 35095
frankness 35102
and 35112
openness 35118
In 35121
civil 35139
offices 35142
this 35171
custom 35192
was 35209
boldly 35229
defended 35240
and 35249
advocated 35271
There 35293
was 35302
some 35311
consciousness 35325
shown 35331
that 35337
promotions 35349
in 35352
the 35358
army 35379
ought 35382
to 35411
be 35416
controlled 35419
by 35440
a 35456
somewhat 35470
different 35474
rule 35482
but 35509
it 35513
seemed 35518
to 35527
be 35566
thought 35581
that 35605
enough 35613
was 35622
done 35631
in 35653
the 35710
way 35713
of 35754
safeguard 35760
when 35768
the 35782
choice 35798
was 35811
confined 35817
to 35841
officers 35845
already 35859
in 35866
service 35873
and 35876
appointments 35893
for 35925
the 35935
highest 35956
grades 35976
were 35996
not 36008
given 36012
to 36019
entirely 36024
new 36030
men 36038
from 36046
civil 36054
life 36057
Each 36060
aspirant 36073
could 36090
find 36096
friends 36100
to 36128
sound 36133
his 36152
praises 36198
and 36243
it 36257
was 36284
easy 36303
to 36312
assert 36319
that 36327
it 36366
was 36371
only 36375
giving 36385
preference 36389
to 36404
one's 36419
friends 36430
among 36455
officers 36459
of 36464
equal 36469
merit 36487
Many 36493
excellent 36506
appointments 36512
were 36515
in 36526
fact 36531
made 36534
and 36538
the 36550
proportion 36571
of 36577
these 36584
would 36599
have 36609
been 36655
greater 36669
if 36679
the 36682
judgment 36699
of 36711
military 36717
superiors 36731
had 36734
been 36750
more 36774
controlling 36788

determining 36839

whole 36856

Mr 36872

humorous 36901
way 36904

actions 36959
may 36979
give 36995
an 37009
impression 37023
of 37073
a 37110
lower 37116
standard 37136
than 37162
he 37166
actually 37174
acknowledged 37179
but 37195
it 37204
cannot 37252
be 37278
denied 37288
that 37308
he 37326

Turchin 43206
had 43213
acted 43257
on 43260
her 43273
own 43282
responsibility 43288
and 43294
the 43298
colonel 43306
did 43312
not 43330
know 43354
of 43367
the 43370
result 43379
till 43394
he 43429
had 43447
gone 43452
home 43473
and 43479
in 43504
an 43511
assembly 43517
of 43524
personal 43539
friends 43541
who 43544
called 43554
upon 43567
him 43570
ostensibly 43636
to 43643
cheer 43672
him 43675
in 43682
his 43723
doleful 43755
despondency 43758
his 43774
wife 43785
brought 43818
the 43834
little 43841
drama 43845
to 43848
its 43902
denouement 43908
by 43932
presenting 43935
him 43948
with 43974
the 43980
appointment 43993
in 43996
their 44011
presence 44043
One 44069
of 44071
the 44087
worst 44102
features 44105
of 44130
the 44145
method 44147
of 44154
appointment 44171
by 44177
slate 44181
made 44190
up 44204
between 44217
congressmen 44230
and 44234
the 44260
executive 44266
was 44298
that 44316
it 44358
filled 44370
up 44373
every 44395
place 44398
allowed 44407
by 44410
law 44432
and 44436
left 44469
nothing 44474
to 44477
be 44485
used 44496
as 44508
a 44514
recognition 44560
for 44565
future 44603
services 44608
in 44619
the 44640
field 44667
except 44676
as 44678
vacancies 44704
occurred 44720
and 44724
these 44736
were 44746
few 44750
and 44755
far 44773
between 44776
The 44780
political 44800
influences 44806
which 44813
determined 44821
the 44829
appointment 44832
were 44853
usually 44882
powerful 44928
enough 44963
to 44973
prevent 44978
dismissal 44981
Whoever 44984
will 44987
trace 45025
the 45030
employment 45039
of 45065
officers 45071
of 45078
the 45153
highest 45163
grades 45171
in 45188
the 45197
last 45210
half 45221
of 45247
the 45250
war 45261
will 45282
find 45289
large 45295
numbers 45319
of 45326
these 45332
on 45337
unimportant 45354
and 45357
nominal 45365
duty 45374
whilst 45377
their 45380
work 45390
in 45398
the 45449
active 45452
armies 45466
was 45470
done 45479
by 45486
men 45544
of 45547
lower 45553
grade 45558
to 45578
whom 45597
the 45600
appropriate 45630
rank 45644
had 45651
to 45660
be 45672
refused 45681
The 45687
system 45710
was 45715
about 45718
as 45741
bad 45761
as 45764
could 45782
be 45793
but 45809
victory 45813
was 45817
won 45825
in 45833
spite 45845
of 45865
it 45873
It 45895
was 45936
fortunate 45951
on 45954
the 45958
whole 45978
that 46014
we 46059
did 46064
not 46067
have 46110
the 46142
grades 46166
of 46177
lieutenant-general 46181
and 46187
general 46190
during 46198
the 46203
war 46224
as 46227
the 46231
Confederates 46235
had 46241
They 46248
made 46258
the 46263
one 46266
the 46271
regular 46318
rank 46331
of 46357
a 46360
corps 46367
commander 46370
and 46415
the 46436
other 46440
of 46444
the 46487
commander 46490
of 46497
an 46511
army 46525
in 46529
the 46540
field 46550
With 46559
us 46564
the 46569
assignment 46576
of 46580
a 46598
major-general 46608
by 46611
the 46625
President 46628
to 46634
command 46642
a 46660
corps 46664
gave 46670
him 46676
a 46686
temporary 46704
precedence 46707
over 46717
other 46724
major-generals 46727
not 46741
so 46745
assigned 46748
and 46762
in 46776
like 46782
manner 46790
for 46806
the 46822
commander 46830
of 46841
an 46852
army 46858
Footnote 46861
Our 46866
system 46874
was 46887
essentially 46903
that 46911
of 46923
the 46929
first 46931
French 46937
Republic 46940
and 46944
the 46958
Consulate 46961
under 46968
which 46972
any 46991
general 46994
of 47001
division 47006
was 47009
assignable 47013
to 47020
an 47023
army 47030
command 47039
in 47042
chief 47049
If 47065
these 47070
were 47083
relieved 47086
they 47097
lost 47109
the 47114
precedence 47137
and 47142
thus 47146
there 47159
was 47169
a 47172
sort 47175
of 47178
temporary 47186
rank 47193
created 47196
giving 47198
a 47201
flexibility 47225
to 47229
the 47232
grade 47235
of 47238
major-general 47241
without 47246
which 47269
we 47276
should 47291
have 47360
been 47388
greatly 47391
embarrassed 47400
Grant's 47407
rank 47413
of 47417
lieutenant-general 47420
was 47423
an 47431
exceptional 47437
grade 47445
made 47454
for 47463
him 47483
alone 47530
when 47553
after 47567
the 47574
battle 47579
of 47610
Missionary 47615
Ridge 47619
he 47649
was 47679
assigned 47691
to 47702
the 47738
command 47772
of 47774
all 47785
the 47791
armies 47794
These 47817
opinions 47827
of 47830
mine 47833
are 47839
not 47860
judgments 47865
formed 47879
after 47894
the 47917
fact 47925
The 47938
weak 47952
points 47955
in 47961
our 47972
army 47985
organization 47997
were 48003
felt 48010
at 48016
the 48034
time 48042
and 48044
I 48053
took 48058
every 48068
means 48077
in 48103
my 48119
power 48137
to 48141
bring 48158
them 48185
to 48191
the 48224
attention 48244
of 48251
the 48255
proper 48258
authorities 48262
State 48285
and 48304
National 48324
At 48341
the 48390
close 48399
of 48440
a 48444
commission 48457
was 48460
appointed 48501
by 48504
the 48511
Secretary 48520
of 48545
War 48589
to 48594
revise 48603
the 48608
articles 48618
of 48624
war 48633
and 48656
army 48668
regulations 48676
Of 48684
this 48691
commission 48699
Major-General 48711
Hitchcock 48726
was 48729
chairman 48748
They 48758
issued 48770
a 48782
circular 48785
calling 48789
for 48794
suggestions 48802
as 48805
to 48819
alterations 48832
supposed 48839
to 48844
be 48857
desirable 48866
and 48876
a 48886
copy 48895
was 48898
sent 48902
to 48921
me 48935
among 48944
others 48948
I 48958
took 48980
occasion 49020
to 49045
report 49053
the 49079
results 49084
of 49087
my 49095
own 49102
experience 49117
and 49122
to 49132
trace 49141
the 49153
evils 49157
which 49162
existed 49165
to 49176
their 49203
sources 49206
in 49216
our 49219
military 49234
system 49237
I 49240
called 49259
attention 49281
to 49286
the 49294
striking 49298
parallel 49302
between 49317
our 49320
practices 49324
and 49347
those 49350
that 49359
had 49365
been 49384
in 49387
use 49414
in 49428
the 49432
first 49450
French 49454
Republic 49521
and 49543
to 49553
the 49563
identical 49570
mischiefs 49596
which 49602
had 49605
resulted 49633
Laxity 49650
of 49667
discipline 49670
straggling 49683
desertion 49687
demagoguery 49705
in 49727
place 49739
of 49762
military 49771
spirit 49789
giving 49795
commissions 49808
as 49823
the 49826
reward 49833
of 49859
mere 49901
recruiting 49948
making 49952
new 49961
regiments 49964
instead 49971
of 50010
filling 50059
up 50064
the 50074
old 50085
ones 50089
absence 50092
of 50097
proper 50108
staff 50113
corps 50123
--every 50128
one 50138
of 50150
these 50160
things 50179
had 50192
been 50206
suffered 50210
in 50242
France 50246
till 50254
they 50275
could 50282
no 50340
longer 50356
be 50359
endured 50368
and 50373
we 50389
had 50404
faithfully 50426
copied 50434
their 50454
errors 50465
without 50469
profiting 50504
by 50512
the 50519
lesson 50527
In 50534
the 50550
freedom 50566
of 50588
private 50596
correspondence 50599
with 50607
Mr 50614
Chase 50633
I 50637
enlarged 50640
upon 50644
the 50658
same 50661
topics 50677
and 50684
urged 50740
him 50789
to 50799
get 50825
the 50850
serious 50860
attention 50869
of 50903
the 50916
President 50934
and 50944
the 50964
cabinet 50978
to 50985
them 50993
I 51031
gave 51034
him 51044
examples 51058
of 51066
the 51074
mischiefs 51078
that 51168
were 51187
done 51199
by 51216
the 51243
insane 51253
efforts 51257
to 51262
raise 51290
new 51294
regiments 51297
by 51309
volunteering 51312
when 51341
we 51358
ought 51364
to 51387
apply 51394
a 51397
conscription 51405
as 51438
the 51441
only 51446
fair 51480
way 51486
of 51511
levying 51518
a 51564
tax 51590
on 51593
the 51598
physical 51612
strength 51620
of 51645
the 51655
nation 51660
I 51664
said 51670
I 51679
have 51683
known 51687
a 51694
lieutenant 51725
to 51732
be 51746
forced 51752
by 51755
his 51759
captain 51770
a 51773
splendid 51777
soldier 51786
to 51796
resign 51803
on 51813
account 51821
of 51832
his 51835
general 51838
inefficiency 51852
I 51856
have 51878
seen 51898
that 51915
same 51920
lieutenant 51930
take 51934
the 51937
field 51945
a 51955
few 51967
months 51970
later 51980
as 51984
lieutenant-colonel 51987
of 51992
a 51995
new 52004
regiment 52007
whilst 52040
the 52043
captain 52054
still 52058
stood 52061
at 52065
the 52070
head 52075
of 52077
his 52080
fraction 52084
of 52099
a 52108
company 52114
in 52119
the 52125
line 52145
This 52148
is 52152
not 52161
a 52175
singular 52183
instance 52186
but 52190
an 52196
example 52201
of 52214
cases 52225
occurring 52241
literally 52247
by 52252
the 52259
thousand 52265
in 52276
our 52288
vast 52298
army 52309
during 52331
the 52335
year 52338
past 52342
Governor 52347
Tod 52350
of 52364
Ohio 52376
said 52379
to 52384
me 52388
some 52404
time 52413
ago 52421
with 52424
the 52441
deepest 52461
sorrow 52477
that 52518
he 52530
was 52536
well 52545
aware 52548
that 52554
in 52557
raising 52571
the 52576
new 52596
regiments 52601
by 52604
volunteering 52608
the 52611
distribution 52634
of 52643
offices 52646
to 52652
the 52680
successful 52687
recruiters 52693
was 52699
filling 52710
the 52719
army 52723
with 52766
incompetent 52775
men 52787
whom 52793
we 52871
should 52885
have 52899
to 52915
sift 52930
out 52957
again 53002
by 53019
such 53035
process 53069
as 53084
we 53095
could 53126
Have 53151
we 53154
time 53158
for 53178
the 53197
sifting 53210
process 53217
Even 53237
if 53246
we 53253
had 53257
how 53268
inefficient 53277
the 53293
process 53297
itself 53300
when 53310
these 53314
officers 53327
have 53330
their 53339
commissions 53342
in 53350
their 53405
pockets 53414
and 53429
cannot 53448
be 53494
brought 53502
before 53527
a 53536
court 53544
or 53548
a 53551
military 53559
commission 53565
till 53573
much 53609
of 53628
the 53633
mischief 53682
they 53710
can 53758
do 53761
is 53773
accomplished 53778
bad 53796
habits 53800
amongst 53806
the 53811
soldiers 53818
formed 53852
and 53862
the 53874
work 53884
of 53897
training 53901
them 53908
made 53911
infinitely 53917
more 53932
difficult 53956
than 53959
with 53981
absolutely 53989
raw 53995
recruits 54002
It 54025
was 54035
in 54131
view 54134
of 54143
such 54148
probable 54159
results 54210
that 54214
I 54244
expressed 54259
the 54271
hope 54286
that 54293
no 54297
more 54317
new 54323
regiments 54328
would 54331
be 54334
raised 54338
by 54347
volunteering 54361
when 54364
in 54370
July 54379
last 54383
the 54389
levy 54398
of 54402
an 54414
additional 54426
force 54454
was 54458
mooted 54479
It 54496
seemed 54500
to 54509
me 54537
that 54540
the 54546
President 54556
could 54560
well 54563
say 54579
to 54591
the 54594
world 54610
'Our 54616
people 54619
have 54625
shown 54637
abundant 54644
proof 54657
of 54683
their 54691
enthusiasm 54702
in 54729

the 54854
number 54864
of 54868
more 54883
than 54885
half 54899

now 55094
as 55117
a 55125
matter 55127
of 55130
military 55147
expediency 55169
call 55205
for 55211

Footnote 55296
From 55301
private 55336
letter 55341
of 55358
Jan 55384
I 55415
urged 55417
with 55425
equal 55440
frankness 55452
the 55456
need 55459
of 55484
giving 55535
unity 55538
to 55545
the 55558
army 55566
by 55581
abolishing 55584
the 55586
distinction 55598
between 55607
regulars 55623
and 55627
volunteers 55640
and 55653
by 55662
a 55664
complete 55691
reorganization 55696
of 55717
the 55773
staff 55778
I 55787
said 55860
it 55880
seemed 55890
absurd 55894
that 55928
with 55931
nearly 55935
a 55962
million 55965
of 55968
men 55980
in 55987
the 56007
field 56036
the 56095
Register 56113
of 56117
the 56126
Army 56129
of 56137
the 56145
United 56152
States 56163
should 56167
show 56177
an 56190
organization 56198
of 56205
some 56216
twenty 56219
regiments 56226
only 56234
of 56240
which 56266
scarce 56293
a 56300
dozen 56309
had 56312
been 56328
in 56344
active 56348
service 56351
If 56361
a 56366
volunteer 56372
organization 56374
is 56378
fit 56389
to 56397
decide 56412
the 56421
great 56425
wars 56435
of 56440
the 56443
nation 56446
is 56455
it 56458
not 56482
ridiculous 56490
to 56519
keep 56526
an 56529
expensive 56544
organization 56576
of 56581
regulars 56594
for 56612
the 56631
petty 56635
contests 56662
with 56665
Indians 56669
or 56673
for 56699
an 56722
ornamental 56741
appendage 56745
to 56748
the 56770
State 56783
in 56792
peace 56800
The 56809
thing 56813
to 56818
be 56831
aimed 56835
at 56840
seemed 56844
to 56849
me 56861
to 56864
be 56870
to 56882
have 56892
a 56898
system 56917
flexible 56936
enough 56943
to 56949
provide 56984
for 56987
the 57012
increase 57029
of 57037
the 57057
army 57063
to 57086
any 57113
size 57121
required 57124
without 57129
losing 57140
any 57161
of 57166
the 57176
advantage 57191
of 57195
character 57199
or 57205
efficiency 57219
which 57229
in 57232
any 57272
respect 57290
pertained 57299
to 57326
it 57338
as 57342
a 57358
regular 57387
army 57411
Circumstances 57422
to 57431
which 57435
I 57442
have 57493
already 57524
alluded 57540
probably 57571
prevented 57578
Mr 57603
Chase 57691
from 57699
taking 57722
any 57734
active 57737
part 57742
again 57759
in 57788
the 57792
discussion 57808
of 57828
army 57853
affairs 57866
in 57876
the 57905
cabinet 57952
Probably 57975
many 57987
of 58054
the 58071
same 58074
ideas 58125
were 58132
urged 58143
upon 58151
the 58192
President 58209
from 58212
other 58227
quarters 58248
for 58252
there 58260
was 58283
much 58308
agitation 58316
of 58329
the 58362
subject 58366
in 58369
the 58380
army 58411
and 58416
out 58462
of 58483
it 58496
But 58501
nothing 58536
came 58554
of 58580
it 58606
for 58610
even 58618
the 58629
draft 58656
when 58659
it 58667
became 58674
the 58679
law 58695
was 58715
used 58718
more 58722
as 58725
a 58730
shameful 58757
whip 58790
to 58793
stimulate 58812
volunteering 58825
than 58832
as 58838
an 58846
honorable 58856
and 58860
right 58885
way 58888
to 58893
fill 58896
the 58901
ranks 58905
of 58908
the 58927
noble 58950
veteran 58971
regiments 58987
General 58998
Sherman 59028
found 59053
in 59071
the 59076
same 59105
wrong 59114
system 59124
thwarting 59135
his 59153
efforts 59163
to 59174
make 59177
his 59181
army 59190
what 59203
it 59211
should 59219
be 59227
and 59234
broke 59237
out 59246
upon 59267

glorious 59326
exasperation 59333

To-morrow 59383
is 59401
the 59404
day 59417
for 59423
the 59429
draft 59441
and 59446
I 59450
feel 59461
more 59466
interested 59471
in 59482
it 59494
than 59516
in 59526
any 59529
event 59532
that 59543
ever 59556
transpired 59560
I 59622
do 59648
think 59655
it 59675
has 59678
been 59689
wrong 59757
to 59760
keep 59794
our 59820
old 59823
troops 59836
so 59851
constantly 59872
under 59875
fire 59883
Some 59897
of 59903
these 59912
old 59933
regiments 59936
that 59942
we 59945
had 59949
at 59975
Shiloh 59980
and 59988
Corinth 60002
have 60021
been 60033
with 60044
me 60052
ever 60056
since 60068
and 60072
some 60090
of 60119
them 60122
have 60124
lost 60130
seventy 60136
per 60139
cent 60152
in 60166
battle 60169
It 60173
looks 60193
hard 60199
to 60240
put 60255
these 60258
brigades 60264
now 60267
numbering 60283
less 60287
than 60301
men 60304
into 60320
battle 60338
They 60344
feel 60378
discouraged 60385
whereas 60398
if 60415
we 60422
could 60456
have 60471
a 60481
steady 60486
influx 60519
of 60534
recruits 60542
the 60548
living 60568
would 60624
soon 60653
forget 60657
the 60689
dead 60692
The 60735
wounded 60746
and 60763
sick 60775
are 60792
lost 60796
to 60803
us 60832
for 60837
once 60841
at 60861
a 60869
hospital 60876
they 60880
become 60883
worthless 60902
It 60915
has 60921
been 60956
a 60961
very 60977
bad 60981
economy 61001
to 61009
kill 61018
off 61029

purpose 62625
to 62661
get 62675
into 62707
active 62746
field 62775
service 62795
had 62811
not 62834
slept 62845
and 62854
soon 62860
after 62870
the 62881
establishment 62941
of 62976
a 63000
winter 63065
organization 63100
in 63126
the 63141
district 63154
I 63183
had 63191
applied 63197
to 63213
be 63226
ordered 63234
to 63272
other 63289
duty 63293
My 63296
fixed 63317
conviction 63324
that 63331
no 63334
useful 63339
military 63347
movements 63379
could 63382
be 63386
made 63426
across 63443
the 63446
mountain 63464
region 63469
implied 63479
that 63483
the 63485
garrisons 63509
of 63526
West 63536
Virginia 63546
should 63560
be 63569
reduced 63581
to 63590
a 63605
minimum 63616
and 63622
confined 63631
to 63652
the 63657
duty 63668
of 63686
defending 63703
the 63732
frontier 63738
of 63759
the 63762
new 63775
State 63796
The 63806
rest 63809
of 63833
the 63836
troops 63860
might 63864
properly 63869
be 63875
added 63917
to 63921
the 63935
active 63945
columns 63950
in 63955
the 63985
field 64000
McClellan 64055
had 64060
been 64071
relieved 64076
of 64082
command 64086
whilst 64108
I 64136
was 64157
conducting 64163
active 64194
operations 64198
in 64208
the 64217
Kanawha 64225
valley 64228
and 64231
Burnside 64238
suffered 64259
his 64262
repulse 64271
at 64280
Fredericksburg 64348
within 64355
a 64371
few 64374
days 64434
after 64437
I 64457
was 64474
directed 64477
to 64480
make 64487
my 64503
headquarters 64507
at 64524
Marietta 64529
and 64534
perfect 64538
the 64551
organization 64578
of 64586
the 64595
district 64600
I 64618
was 64622
therefore 64632
at 64649
a 64658
loss 64673
to 64683
choose 64693
where 64724
I 64728
would 64737
serve 64746
even 64769
if 64772
I 64784
had 64812
been 64815
given 64822
carte 64832
blanche 64835
to 64852
determine 64862
my 64867
own 64875
work 64906
Enough 64982
was 64990
known 65003
of 65011
the 65026
reasons 65029
for 65042
the 65062
President's 65076
dissatisfaction 65090
with 65108
McClellan 65126
to 65129
make 65133
me 65150
admit 65258
that 65266
the 65312
change 65327
of 65332
command 65354
was 65356
an 65359
apparent 65371
necessity 65377
yet 65389
much 65418
was 65426
unknown 65432
and 65458
the 65464
full 65471
strength 65485
of 65501
the 65510
President's 65542
case 65553
was 65561
not 65572
revealed 65592
till 65614
the 65636
war 65649
was 65657
over 65686
My 65697
personal 65704
friendship 65731
for 65735
McClellan 65741
remained 65759
warm 65769
and 65783
I 65791
felt 65795
sure 65800
that 65821
Hooker 65835
as 65855
a 65862
commander 65866
would 65895
be 65899
a 65921
long 65926
step 65938
downward 65944
In 65951
private 65965
I 65970
did 65980
not 66017
hesitate 66034
to 66052
express 66058
the 66062
wish 66070
that 66084
McClellan 66089
should 66102
still 66112
be 66115
intrusted 66126
with 66134
the 66144
command 66148
of 66151
the 66155
Potomac 66173
army 66177
that 66187
it 66196
should 66213
be 66219
strongly 66230
reinforced 66234
and 66246
that 66249
by 66256
constant 66277
pressure 66373
upon 66405
its 66408
commander 66413
his 66441
indecision 66457
of 66469
character 66477
might 66494
be 66497
overcome 66515
Those 66530
who 66545
were 66554
near 66560
to 66577
McClellan 66600
believed 66617
that 66621
he 66633
was 66645

this 66996
opinion 66999

was 67026

Yet 67210
it 67213
must 67223
be 67240
confessed 67260
that 67276
we 67282
did 67298
not 67306
know 67322
half 67339
the 67346
discouragements 67357
that 67372
were 67376
weighing 67391
upon 67438
the 67469
President 67477

his 67527
Secretary 67534

first 68394
effect 68419
was 68468
naturally 68483
depressing 68490
and 68504
it 68508
took 68550
a 68554

time 68562

some 68576
philosophy 68595

on 71998
the 72008

he 72080
thought 72083
the 72096
intention 72127

been 72195

our 73456

death 73513

Whatever 73621

may 73687
have 73704

were 73729
set 73736
aside 73741
by 73766
orders 73800
from 73808
Washington 73813
which 73846
met 73879
me 73887
at 73903

me 73915

report 73929
at 73933
Columbus 73938

to 73951

This 74181
was 74188
accompanied 74195
by 74204
the 74222
assurance 74225
that 74229
this 74236
duty 74240
would 74243
be 74246
but 74271
temporary 74278

had 74754
something 74790
to 74811
do 74860
with 74863
this 74907
assignment 74914
but 74973
I 74985
did 74994
not 74999
ask 75005
permission 75014
to 75038

war 75720
my 75731
stay 75736
there 75741
would 75752
have 75756
been 75762
intolerable 75765
since 75777
General 75782
Milroy 75806
in 75830
whose 75835
judgment 75856
I 75876
had 75906
less 75923

put 76410
over 76425
my 76441
head 76452
I 76457
could 76464
not 76468
then 76471
foresee 76474
the 76491
cost 76495
the 76524
country 76536
would 76553
pay 76558
for 76562
this 76583
in 76598

next 76640
summer's 76646
campaign 76651
in 76669
the 76686
Shenandoah 76711
but 76720
every 76724
instinct 76731
urged 76738
me 76756
to 76767
sever 76784
a 76791
connection 76819
which 76851
could 76864
bode 76866
no 76869
good 76899
The 76903
reasonableness 76923
of 76946
my 76970
objection 76973
to 76979
serving 76982
as 76985
a 76989
subordinate 77003
where 77007
I 77010
had 77026
been 77035
in 77040
command 77046
was 77049
recognized 77075
and 77104
the 77107
arrangement 77111
actually 77114
made 77118
was 77122
as 77130
acceptable 77134
as 77143
anything 77146
except 77181
a 77184
division 77187
in 77201
an 77210
active 77213
army 77218
It 77221
greatly 77225
added 77231
to 77244
my 77247
contentment 77250
to 77259
learn 77296
that 77341
General 77344
Burnside 77347
had 77359
been 77369
ordered 77374
to 77379
the 77382

the 77401

would 77422
be 77436
my 77438
immediate 77446
superior 77465
I 77470
hastened 77473
back 77476
to 77489
Marietta 77492
closed 77497
up 77524
the 77526
business 77532
pending 77555

went 77611

General 77805

proved 77815
to 77839

the 77847
formation 77858
of 77863
the 77868
Military 77883
District 77887
of 77904
Ohio 77907
including 77916
the 77941
whole 77958
State 77963
I 77970
was 77973
placed 77996
in 78003
command 78006
of 78029
this 78032
district 78059
reporting 78090
directly 78100

the 78130
general 78133
who 78153
himself 78177
conferred 78180

My 78228
own 78232
relations 78242

superiors 78270
were 78274
thus 78293
made 78297
strictly 78300
military 78327
which 78375
was 78399
a 78421
much 78434
pleasanter 78446
thing 78449
for 78482
me 78493
than 78527
direct 78552
connection 78557
with 78590
the 78604
civil 78608
authorities 78611
would 78639
be 78650

with 79427

All 79437
this 79463
was 79500
done 79549
with 79553
the 79556
most 79560
cordial 79565
understanding 79580
between 79592
Burnside 79599

the 79613

Indeed 79625
nothing 79628
could 79632
be 79666
more 79670
perfect 79689
than 79720
the 79726

The 80748

all 80800

The 81097
exemptions 81101
on 81112
account 81118
of 81123
physical 81138
defects 81147
were 81158
submitted 81166
to 81200
a 81236
board 81240
of 81255
three 81265
of 81271
which 81275
the 81279
local 81293

a 81803

be 81911
taken 81926
in 81929
place 81950
of 81978
personal 81983
service 81995
that 82006
sum 82053
being 82118
thought 82120
sufficient 82149
to 82158
secure 82168
a 82193
voluntary 82200
recruit 82203
by 82206
the 82221
government 82225
The 82251
principal 82269
effect 82274
of 82308
this 82311
provision 82314
was 82317
to 82330
establish 82372
a 82382
current 82389
market 82405
price 82413
for 82416
substitutes 82428
The 82469
general 82472
provisions 82475
of 82490
the 82509
law 82535
for 82540
the 82543
drafting 82546
were 82551
wise 82576
and 82602
well 82605
matured 82609
and 82615
the 82632
rules 82636
for 82644
the 82682
subordinate 82689
details 82691
were 82702
well 82712
digested 82717
and 82745
admirably 82774
administered 82777
by 82792
Colonel 82796
Fry 82832
and 82839
his 82862
bureau 82902
It 82922
was 82949
a 82952
delicate 82981
and 83017
difficult 83036
task 83044
but 83100
it 83116
was 83119
carried 83132
out 83141
with 83144
such 83169
patience 83214
honesty 83224
and 83233
thoroughness 83241
that 83259
nothing 83263
better 83266
could 83273
be 83281
done 83327
than 83344
copy 83347
it 83403
if 83440
a 83459
future 83462
necessity 83468
for 83473
like 83488
work 83552
should 83590
arise 83597
There 83608
was 83640
no 83657
good 83668
ground 83673
for 83695
complaint 83701
and 83727
in 83767
those 83778
cases 83788
where 83801
as 83806
in 83811
New 83840
York 83865
hostile 83870
political 83874
leaders 83885
raised 83892
the 83896
cry 83959
of 83962
unfairness 83965
and 83988
provoked 84011
collision 84033
between 84048
the 84074
mob 84080
and 84083
the 84117
National 84120
authorities 84146
the 84154
victims 84161
were 84167
proved 84191
to 84202
be 84207
the 84223
dupes 84259
of 84281
ignorance 84292
and 84294
malice 84303
The 84318
administration 84321
of 84378
the 84381
law 84387
was 84411
thoroughly 84424
vindicated 84434
and 84452
if 84480
there 84492
were 84498
to 84516
be 84535
a 84544
draft 84559
at 84563
all 84571
it 84574
could 84577
not 84611
be 84642
more 84647
fairly 84665
and 84728
justly 84739
enforced 84747
There 84775
was 84793
room 84796
for 84811
difference 84827
of 84833
opinion 84855
as 84865
to 84870
some 84895
of 84909
the 84930
provisions 84937
of 84941
the 84947
law 84952
regarding 84969
exemption 84984
and 84998
substitution 85048
but 85056
the 85062
most 85071
serious 85078
question 85104
was 85111
raised 85127
by 85144
the 85159
section 85174
which 85190
applied 85203
to 85209
old 85214
regiments 85230
and 85251
which 85260
had 85283
nothing 85294
to 85300
do 85307
with 85313
the 85320
enrolment 85344
and 85366
draft 85374
This 85389
section 85395
directed 85400
that 85434
when 85439
regiments 85476
had 85479
become 85537
reduced 85563
in 85597
numbers 85616
by 85629
any 85632
cause 85648
the 85654
officers 85667
of 85687
the 85690
regiment 85698
should 85729
be 85738
proportionately 85741
diminished 85757
As 85797
new 85823
regiments 85826
were 85835
still 85839
received 85856
and 85866
credited 85900
upon 85908
the 85921
State's 85937
liability 85950
under 85953
the 85956
draft 85975
it 85978
of 85988
course 85991
resulted 85995
that 86017
the 86020
old 86055
regiments 86062
continued 86067
to 86079
decay 86093
A 86101
public 86134
sentiment 86145
had 86224
been 86249
created 86267
which 86289
looked 86313
upon 86333
the 86349
draft 86352
as 86368
a 86440
disgrace 86443
and 86488
the 86502
most 86510
extraordinary 86515
efforts 86544
were 86611
made 86630
to 86633
escape 86680
it 86685
Extra 86690
bounties 86695
for 86698
volunteering 86722
were 86733
paid 86744
by 86748
counties 86755
and 86765
towns 86769
and 86772
the 86821
combination 86825
of 86832
influences 86844
was 86862
so 86876
powerful 86890
that 86909
it 86941
was 86950
successful 86953
in 86957
most 86981
localities 86994
and 87008
very 87015
few 87040
men 87079
were 87104
actually 87108
put 87115
in 87118
the 87124
ranks 87147
by 87159
the 87193
draft 87210
The 87216
offer 87251
of 87263
extra 87298
bounties 87301
to 87314
induce 87320
volunteering 87324
brought 87335
into 87353
existence 87365
bounty-jumping 87371
a 87402
new 87425
crime 87434
analogous 87440
to 87467
that 87473
of 87509
repeating 87526
at 87531
elections 87536
A 87542
man 87555
would 87559
enlist 87566
and 87577
receive 87599
the 87624
bounty 87674
frequently 87692
several 87699
hundred 87733
dollars 87736
but 87741
varying 87759
somewhat 87770
in 87780
different 87798
places 87830
and 87834
periods 87839
He 87844
would 87853
take 87858
an 87864
early 87876
opportunity 87880
to 87883
desert 87887
as 87899
he 87902
had 87932
intended 87946
to 87950
do 87958
from 87961
the 88053
first 88056
Changing 88059
his 88063
name 88075
he 88114
would 88124
go 88127
to 88134
some 88146
new 88165
locality 88168
and 88172
enlist 88175
again 88178
repeating 88183
the 88207
fraud 88209
as 88233
often 88328
as 88340
he 88347
could 88354
escape 88362
detection 88376
The 88381
urgency 88386
to 88397
get 88400
recruits 88408
and 88414
forward 88418
them 88422
at 88431
once 88436
to 88462
the 88488
field 88499
and 88517
the 88530
wide 88536
country 88538
which 88564
was 88574
open 88580
to 88583
recruiting 88642
made 88644
the 88659
risk 88669
of 88672
punishment 88744
very 88772
small 88775
Occasionally 88811
one 88814
was 88823
caught 88859
and 88862
he 88873
would 88876
of 88897
course 88925
be 88930
liable 88964
to 88970
punishment 88974
as 88980
a 88986
deserter 89052
The 89058

Another 89541
evil 89544
incidental 89590
to 89593
the 89607
excessive 89618
stimulus 89622
of 89628
volunteering 89645
was 89652
a 89675
political 89690
one 89709
which 89713
threatened 89739
serious 89742
results 89752
It 89809
deranged 89823
the 89828
natural 89831
political 89834
balance 89845
of 89886
the 89889
country 89896
by 89913
sending 89921
the 89938
most 89948
patriotic 89954
young 89976
men 90003
to 90007
the 90023
field 90033
and 90045
thus 90093
giving 90096
an 90104
undue 90111
power 90120
to 90124
the 90129
disaffected 90134
and 90149
to 90152
the 90170
opponents 90183
of 90189
the 90198
administration 90212
This 90233
led 90243
to 90252
the 90266
State 90269
laws 90298
for 90302
allowing 90312
the 90316
soldiers 90339
to 90355
vote 90377
wherever 90382
they 90385
might 90394

votes 90411
being 90417
certified 90421

sent 90437
home 90440
In 90464
its 90469
very 90477
nature 90480
this 90512
was 90516
a 90522
makeshift 90533
and 90542
a 90551
very 90563
dubious 90566
expedient 90586
to 90604
cure 90613
the 90624
mischief 90627
It 90636
would 90642
not 90645
have 90652
been 90658
necessary 90661
if 90669
we 90700
had 90706
had 90736
at 90745
an 90751
early 90763
day 90780
a 90790
system 90824
of 90827
recruiting 90836
that 90842
would 90855
have 90871
drawn 90875
more 90886
evenly 90905
from 90911
different 90919

into 90940

military 91015
officers 91055
of 91061
the 91068

nothing 91106
to 91112
do 91135

the 91147

resistance 91197

large 91345

the 91490
numbers 91507
actually 91512
drafted 91520
in 91531
Ohio 91536
in 91539
were 91549
insignificant 91554
for 91557
reasons 91561
already 91573
stated 91586

or 91618
four 91624
very 91642
small 91660

were 91689
the 91692
only 91701
forces 91707
at 91718
my 91724
command 91730
and 91738
these 91749
were 91781
reduced 91841
to 91872
the 91878
minimum 91881
necessary 91888
to 91904
guard 91912
the 91917
prison 91932

General 92011
Burnside 92015
had 92022
not 92025
come 92028
West 92038
with 92059
a 92073
purpose 92076
to 92087
content 92094
himself 92137
with 92160
the 92183
retiracy 92192
of 92210
a 92217
department 92221
out 92255
of 92269
the 92307
theatre 92311
of 92328
actual 92331
war 92347
His 92370
department 92378
included 92391
eastern 92394
Kentucky 92405
and 92408
afforded 92437
a 92452
base 92457
for 92463
operations 92475
in 92515
the 92533
direction 92541
of 92545
East 92549
Tennessee 92555
Mr 92559
Lincoln 92563
had 92567
never 92580
lost 92584
his 92591
eagerness 92599
and 92603
zeal 92609
to 92612
give 92614
assistance 92674
to 92680
the 92687
loyal 92697
mountaineers 92706
and 92711
had 92717
arranged 92721
with 92726
Burnside 92732
a 92753
plan 92761
of 92767
co-operation 92779
with 92790
Rosecrans 92810
by 92822
which 92840
the 92865
former 92870
should 92891
move 92907
from 92911
Lexington 92922
Ky 92930
upon 92935
Knoxville 92938
whilst 92946
the 92999
latter 93021
marched 93025
from 93036
Murfreesboro 93044
Tenn 93061
upon 93064
Chattanooga 93067
This 93074
was 93077
better 93082
than 93123
the 93149
impracticable 93182
plan 93198
of 93206
which 93226
aimed 93229
at 93248
the 93252
occupation 93263
of 93272
East 93276
Tennessee 93289
before 93294
Chattanooga 93302
had 93307
been 93310
taken 93328
and 93343
the 93346
task 93355
was 93389
at 93393
last 93416
accomplished 93432
by 93435
the 93440
method 93457
now 93498
used 93501
It 93508
was 93520
by 93541
no 93544
means 93548
the 93561
best 93574
or 93591
most 93611
economical 93620
method 93623
which 93631
would 93637
have 93649
been 93696
to 93723
have 93727
but 93736
one 93758
strong 93771
army 93785
till 93811
Chattanooga 93814
were 93838
firmly 93851
in 93861
our 93868
hands 93872
and 93878
then 93904
direct 93910
a 93913
subordinate 93939
column 93963
upon 93975
the 93978
upper 93983
Holston 94012
valley 94055
It 94060
was 94083
utterly 94091
impossible 94104
to 94113
keep 94123
up 94134
a 94145
line 94161
of 94166
supply 94176
for 94185
an 94194
army 94218
in 94222
East 94239
Tennessee 94255
by 94288
the 94297
wagon 94319
roads 94336
over 94369
the 94378
mountains 94402
The 94410
railroad 94413
through 94418
Chattanooga 94428
was 94433
indispensable 94452
for 94474
this 94483
purpose 94517
But 94564
Mr 94621
Lincoln 94626
had 94663
not 94700
fully 94705
appreciated 94712
this 94720
and 94723
was 94726
discontented 94738
that 94741
both 94766
Buell 94780
and 94810
Rosecrans 94813
had 94821
in 94844
turn 94855
paid 94871
little 94874
attention 94897
as 94913
it 94942
seemed 94945
to 94948
his 94968
desire 94971
to 94982
make 94988
the 95002
liberation 95007
of 95010
East 95029
Tennessee 95037
the 95040
primary 95043
and 95060
immediate 95066
aim 95077
of 95083
their 95088
campaigns 95093
He 95099
had 95114
therefore 95125
determined 95129
to 95138
show 95153
his 95156
own 95163
faith 95166
in 95171
Burnside 95184
and 95191
his 95196
approval 95199
of 95214
the 95243
man 95245
by 95255
giving 95265
him 95270
a 95286
small 95290
but 95299
active 95312
army 95326
in 95332
the 95335
field 95339
and 95342
to 95345
carry 95356
out 95368
his 95378
cherished 95392
purpose 95405
by 95435
having 95461
it 95468
march 95483
directly 95487
over 95527
the 95543
Cumberland 95562
Mountains 95572
whilst 95586
Rosecrans 95595
was 95601
allowed 95608
to 95639
carry 95643
out 95648
the 95651
plan 95665
on 95668
which 95696
the 95702
commanders 95709
of 95723
the 95732
Cumberland 95745
army 95748
seemed 95752
in 95756
the 95765
President's 95789
opinion 95795
too 95824
stubbornly 95829
bent 95842
Burnside's 95846
old 95869
corps 95886
the 95889
Ninth 95893
was 95904
taken 95911
from 95915
the 95920
Army 95925
of 95934
the 95950
Potomac 95953
and 95956
sent 95973
to 95976
Kentucky 95979
and 95983
a 95992
new 95997
corps 96001
to 96022
be 96043
called 96046
the 96049
Twenty-third 96058
was 96064
soon 96073
authorized 96083
to 96086
contain 96090
the 96102
Tennessee 96105
regiments 96112
which 96115
had 96120
been 96124
in 96127
General 96130
Morgan's 96136
command 96146
and 96151
two 96156
divisions 96164
made 96176
up 96181
of 96201
new 96221
regiments 96232
organized 96235
in 96270
Ohio 96286
Indiana 96305
and 96320
Illinois 96350
under 96354
the 96360
last 96373
call 96377
for 96404
volunteers 96455
To 96467
these 96476
were 96483
added 96497
several 96503

Burnside's 96663

was 96688

In 96920
a 96926
former 96946
chapter 96949
I 96964
have 96970
spoken 96977
of 96981
Hartsuff's 96986
abilities 96989

ante 97113
His 97135
qualities 97142
as 97145
a 97148
general 97165
officer 97170
had 97176
not 97248
been 97251
tried 97257
He 97275
was 97286
wounded 97296
at 97301
the 97305
beginning 97310
of 97314
the 97319
engagement 97327
at 97352
Antietam 97363
where 97368
he 97373

corps 97462

ante 97504
That 97510
was 97514
his 97517
first 97523
service 97530
under 97547
his 97560
appointment 97563
as 97573
brigadier 97576
and 97586
he 97589
had 97593
necessarily 97596
been 97623
out 97639
of 97642
the 97661
field 97667
since 97690
that 97696
time 97721
My 97725
own 97743
expectation 97747
was 97752
that 97770
he 97774
would 97777
make 97781
an 97784
excellent 97810
reputation 97837
as 97840
a 97843
corps 97848
commander 97861
but 97865
it 97871
was 97882
not 97886
his 97892
fortune 97895
to 97929
see 97939
much 97942
continuous 97982
field 97987
service 97997
His 98003
health 98023
was 98028
seriously 98041
affected 98068
by 98073
his 98076
wounds 98082
and 98086
after 98090
a 98094
short 98115
trial 98128
of 98134
active 98146
campaigning 98150
he 98156
was 98160
obliged 98169
to 98175
seek 98181
more 98193
quiet 98196
employment 98201
The 98208
establishment 98212
of 98218
my 98227
headquarters 98231
at 98237
Cincinnati 98240
threw 98248
me 98285
once 98299
more 98307
into 98312
close 98356
personal 98363
relations 98371
with 98375
Burnside 98389
and 98394
enabled 98400
me 98404
to 98421
learn 98430
his 98435
character 98445
more 98450
intimately 98453
His 98456
adjutant-general's 98480
office 98485
was 98493
on 98501
East 98513
Fourth 98561
Street 98564
and 98567
most 98585
of 98602
the 98605
routine 98609
work 98612
was 98616
done 98657
there 98661
The 98668
general 98692
had 98698
his 98706
own 98709
quarters 98712
on 98721
Ninth 98729
Street 98732
where 98741
he 98759
had 98791
also 98813
an 98831
office 98839
for 98847
himself 98857
and 98864
his 98878
aides-de-camp 98882
My 98902
own 98905
office 98908
and 98922
the 98925
official 98928
headquarters 98931
of 98945
the 98948
district 98971
were 98974
on 98982
Broadway 98986
below 98989
Fourth 98992

the 99029

now 99042
occupied 99066
by 99096
the 99103
Natural 99114
History 99119
Society 99172
There 99179
was 99189
thus 99197
near 99208
half 99215
a 99248
mile 99254
between 99266
us 99309
though 99320
I 99325
was 99328
but 99334
a 99345
little 99348
way 99397
from 99415
the 99419
adjutant-general 99422
of 99427
the 99441
department 99452
through 99489
whose 99493
office 99497
my 99510
regular 99521
business 99535
with 99542
the 99564
general 99593
went 99599
Burnside 99610
however 99619
loved 99640
to 99650
discuss 99654
department 99657
affairs 99667
informally 99671
and 99700
with 99721
the 99749
perfect 99762
freedom 99811
of 99826
unrestrained 99865
social 99873
intercourse 99880
When 99897
he 99899
gave 99917
his 99920
confidence 99933
he 99936
gave 99969
it 99976
without 99980
reserve 99987
and 99990
encouraged 99999
the 100012
fullest 100019
and 100044
freest 100048
criticism 100095
of 100103
his 100111
own 100115
plans 100171
and 100179
purposes 100184
His 100187
decisions 100210
would 100217
then 100220
be 100223
put 100251
in 100266
official 100270
form 100273
by 100287
the 100289
proper 100296
officers 100300
of 100320
the 100335
staff 100341
and 100356
would 100364
be 100369
transmitted 100387
though 100393
I 100395
was 100406
nearly 100409
always 100415
personally 100427
aware 100436
of 100440
what 100444
was 100450
to 100460
be 100464
ordered 100467
before 100487
the 100491
formal 100497
papers 100513
reached 100516
me 100523
He 100540
had 100547
very 100556
little 100560
pride 100563
of 100572
opinion 100582
and 100585
was 100601
perfectly 100610
candid 100662
in 100699
weighing 100702
whatever 100712
was 100716
contrary 100725
to 100729
his 100731
predilections 100739
yet 100745
he 100770
was 100774
not 100787
systematic 100791
in 100804
his 100829
business 100839
methods 100851
and 100854
was 100860
quite 100879
apt 100884
to 100889
decide 100896
first 100913
and 100964
discuss 100972
afterward 100975
He 100988
never 100992
found 100999
fault 101002
with 101009
a 101015
subordinate 101019
for 101038
assuming 101050
responsibility 101057
or 101060
acting 101068
without 101078
orders 101082
provided 101089
he 101094
was 101097
assured 101126
of 101129
his 101138
earnest 101142
good 101148
purpose 101152
in 101155
doing 101160
so 101163
In 101165
such 101180
cases 101187
he 101190
would 101193
assume 101204
the 101209
responsibility 101212
for 101220
what 101223
was 101226
done 101238
as 101246
cheerfully 101267
as 101281
if 101285
he 101292
had 101296
given 101300
the 101304
order 101324
In 101339
like 101349
manner 101355
he 101368
was 101372
careless 101381
of 101400
forms 101406
himself 101409
in 101420
doing 101432
whatever 101438
seemed 101453
necessary 101460
or 101468
proper 101480
and 101483
might 101487

officers 101568
to 101581
reach 101591
immediately 101594
the 101597
persons 101605
who 101626
were 101645
to 101652
act 101667
or 101672
the 101687
things 101697
to 101700

done 101717
There 101738
was 101750
no 101753
intentional 101784
slight 101787
to 101790
any 101802
one 101805
in 101810
this 101814
it 101875
was 101878
only 101915
a 101919
characteristic 101933
carelessness 101947
of 102007
routine 102011
Martinets 102032
would 102036
be 102040
exasperated 102078
by 102120
it 102123
and 102146
would 102153
be 102165
pretty 102201
sure 102244
to 102247
quarrel 102261
with 102266
him 102276
No 102279
doubt 102284
it 102291
was 102294
a 102336
bad 102367
business 102382
method 102391
and 102396
had 102416
its 102453
mischiefs 102461
and 102468
inconveniences 102476
A 102479
story 102483
used 102516
to 102520
go 102541
the 102544
rounds 102563
a 102568
little 102582
later 102588
that 102599
soldiers 102611
belonging 102640
to 102643
the 102655
little 102659
army 102663
in 102685
East 102690
Tennessee 102694
were 102697
sometimes 102704
arrested 102709
at 102714
their 102719
homes 102753
and 102759
sent 102763
back 102780
as 102797
deserters 102815
when 102826
they 102848
would 102858
produce 102862
a 102869
furlough 102890
written 102901
by 102905
Burnside 102934
on 102945
a 102961
leaf 102965
of 102977
his 102981
pocket 102988
memorandum-book 102999
which 103033
as 103053
they 103065
said 103072
had 103076
been 103100
given 103105
by 103110
him 103114
after 103128
hearing 103149
a 103168
pitiful 103172
story 103174
which 103184
moved 103191
his 103211
sympathies 103215
Such 103238
inventions 103263
were 103277
a 103288
kind 103295
of 103302
popular 103325
recognition 103331
of 103334
his 103339
well-known 103343
neglect 103347
of 103350
forms 103357
as 103376
well 103379
as 103384
of 103408
his 103411
kind 103418
heart 103425
There 103430
was 103443
an 103454
older 103460
story 103467
about 103473
him 103480
to 103484
the 103496
effect 103502
that 103516
when 103523
a 103526
lieutenant 103529
in 103536
the 103586
army 103593
he 103651
had 103658
been 103666
made 103671
post-quartermaster 103675
at 103682
some 103686
little 103696
frontier 103700
garrison 103704
and 103717
that 103726
his 103731
accounts 103746
and 103751
returns 103760
got 103766
into 103771
such 103792
confusion 103798
that 103802
after 103805
several 103822
pretty 103837
sharp 103847
reminders 103856
the 103859
quartermaster-general 103863
notified 103867
him 103870
as 103875
a 103888
final 103891
terror 103900
that 103905
he 103912
would 103917
send 103926
a 103929
special 103937
officer 103941
and 103950
subject 103959
him 103965
and 103968
his 103971
papers 103977
to 103980
a 103990
severe 104001
scrutiny 104004
As 104007
the 104019
story 104038
ran 104042
Burnside 104046
in 104054
transparent 104059
honesty 104073
wrote 104088
a 104093
cordial 104097
letter 104101
of 104109
thanks 104124
in 104160
reply 104170
saying 104173
it 104180
was 104193
just 104201
what 104220
he 104227
desired 104264
as 104271
he 104278
had 104295
been 104309
trying 104312
hard 104326
to 104332
make 104335
his 104355
accounts 104359
up 104362
but 104383
had 104388
to 104394
confess 104398
he 104404
could 104425
do 104435
nothing 104460
with 104496
them 104523
but 104541
was 104544
sure 104560
such 104584
an 104599
expert 104614
would 104640
straighten 104643
them 104668
In 104734
my 104750
own 104758
service 104767
under 104771
him 104794
I 104803
often 104825
found 104829
occasion 104837
to 104841
supply 104845
the 104850
formal 104863
links 104868
in 104872
the 104877
official 104885
chain 104889
so 104892
that 104904
business 104911
would 104928
move 104934
on 104953
according 104967
to 104973
regulations 104976
but 104983
any 104999
trouble 105007
that 105041
was 105045
made 105056
in 105060
this 105069
way 105072
was 105076
much 105079
more 105093
than 105103
compensated 105107
by 105110
the 105119
generous 105122
trust 105127
with 105143
which 105147
he 105152
allowed 105158
his 105167
name 105171
and 105175
authority 105185
to 105189
be 105201
used 105205
when 105210
prompt 105213
action 105217
would 105228
serve 105240
the 105243
greater 105252
ends 105258
in 105265
view 105269
My 105274
habit 105277
was 105305
to 105329
go 105348
to 105369
his 105373
private 105445
quarters 105448
on 105455
Ninth 105460
Street 105465
when 105469
the 105502
regular 105505
business 105508
of 105514
the 105525
day 105536
was 105540
over 105549
and 105558
there 105562
get 105575
the 105580
military 105638
news 105647
and 105651
confer 105655
with 105675
him 105681
on 105693
pending 105710
or 105715
prospective 105723
business 105727
affecting 105736
my 105763
own 105781
district 105784
His 105798
attractive 105802
personality 105825
made 105834
him 105837
the 105840
centre 105846
of 105849
a 105875
good 105878
deal 105883
of 105886
society 105899
and 105907
business 105911
would 105931
drop 105936
into 105940
the 105945
background 105965
till 105969
late 105980
in 105986
the 105990
evening 105996
when 106002
his 106009
guests 106029
voluntarily 106033
departed 106036
Then 106041
perhaps 106052
after 106062
midnight 106067
he 106079
would 106094
take 106102
up 106105
the 106108
arrears 106112
of 106119
work 106122
and 106127
dictate 106147
letters 106155
orders 106158
and 106164
dispatches 106167
turning 106171
night 106183
into 106192
day 106203
It 106221
not 106228
unfrequently 106236
happened 106277
that 106280
after 106301
making 106310
my 106314
usual 106318
official 106333
call 106337
in 106340
the 106344
afternoon 106351
I 106354
had 106362
gone 106367
to 106370
my 106373
quarters 106384
and 106403
to 106410
bed 106416
at 106421
my 106425
usual 106437
hour 106454
when 106460
I 106467
would 106475
be 106490
roused 106511
by 106553
an 106561
orderly 106601
from 106605
the 106626
general 106631
begging 106654
that 106668
I 106684
would 106687
come 106696
up 106699
and 106705
consult 106710
with 106739
him 106742
on 106759
some 106765
matter 106792
of 106797
neglected 106812
business 106818
He 106840
was 106869
always 106881
bright 106905
and 106921
clear 106930
in 106933
those 106937
late 107003
hours 107017
and 107029
when 107035
he 107046
buckled 107065
to 107068
work 107071
rapidly 107075
disposed 107094
of 107098
it 107104
He 107113
did 107143
not 107149
indulge 107156
much 107163
in 107181
retrospect 107215
and 107228
rarely 107242
referred 107252
to 107263
his 107277
misfortunes 107284
in 107289
the 107293
Army 107296
of 107317
the 107321
Potomac 107328
On 107333
one 107365
or 107372
two 107381
occasions 107403
he 107420
discussed 107451
his 107458
Fredericksburg 107465
campaign 107468
with 107476
me 107493
The 107503
delay 107517
in 107520
sending 107526
pontoons 107534
from 107541
Washington 107547
to 107557
Falmouth 107569
which 107573
gave 107581
Lee 107588
time 107598
to 107606
concentrate 107611
at 107635
Fredericksburg 107645
he 107659
reasonably 107665
argued 107679
was 107693
the 107702
fault 107709
of 107721
the 107736
military 107748
authorities 107760
at 107763
Washington 107771
but 107773
I 107776
could 107791
easily 107808
see 107812
that 107831
if 107839
his 107844
supervision 107847
of 107867
business 107875
had 107879
been 107882
more 107886
rigidly 107891
systematic 107895
he 107911
would 107917
have 107921
made 107925
sure 107929
that 107960
he 107965
was 107969
not 107974
to 108013
be 108016
disappointed 108048
in 108052
his 108055
means 108059
of 108088
crossing 108104
the 108107
Rappahannock 108110
promptly 108118
As 108126
to 108130
the 108149
battle 108155
itself 108159
he 108172
steadily 108186
insisted 108190
that 108195
the 108198
advance 108208
of 108211
Meade's 108227
division 108235
proved 108279
that 108305
if 108326
all 108334
the 108345
left 108357
wing 108361
had 108368
acted 108372
with 108378
equal 108382
vigor 108390
and 108429
promptness 108448
Marye's 108481
heights 108486
would 108504
have 108544
been 108550
turned 108553
and 108557
carried 108578
It 108597
is 108601
due 108654
to 108672
him 108675
to 108684
repeat 108693
that 108719
in 108731
such 108744
discussions 108757
his 108762
judgment 108767
of 108773
men 108784
and 108789
their 108805
motives 108810
was 108814
always 108827
kind 108830
and 108832
charitable 108854
I 108895
never 108906
heard 108915
him 108931
say 108936
anything 108962
bitter 108987
even 108997
of 109002
those 109013
whom 109018
I 109030
knew 109037
he 109047
distrusted 109050
At 109057
the 109066
time 109080
I 109083
am 109086
speaking 109090
of 109098
Cincinnati 109104
was 109152
in 109159
a 109183
curious 109187
political 109191
and 109194
social 109200
condition 109206
The 109219
advance 109222
through 109226
Kentucky 109244
of 109258
Bragg 109261
and 109275
Kirby 109298
Smith 109301
in 109313
the 109326
preceding 109383
year 109386
had 109389
made 109392
it 109396
a 109406
centre 109420
for 109422
rebel 109435
sympathizers 109439
The 109458
fact 109476
that 109496
a 109512
Confederate 109518
army 109531
had 109551
approached 109563
the 109568
hills 109577
that 109585
bordered 109601
the 109612
river 109636
had 109648
revived 109656
the 109665
hopes 109679
and 109699
the 109706
confidence 109709
of 109714
many 109739
who 109787
while 109792
wishing 109798
success 109809
to 109825
the 109829
Southern 109844
cause 109851
had 109855
done 109862
so 109875
in 109879
a 109886
vague 109892
and 109914
distant 109936
way 109939
Now 109955
it 109964
seemed 109972
nearer 109975
to 109991
them 109998
and 110004
the 110008
stimulus 110020
to 110031
personal 110057
activity 110064
was 110067
greater 110070
There 110085
was 110105
always 110109
in 110121
the 110141
city 110145
a 110153
considerable 110163
and 110179
influential 110211
body 110221
of 110224
business 110227
men 110249
who 110256
were 110270
of 110280
Southern 110284
families 110298
and 110301
besides 110320
this 110324
the 110340
trade 110361
connections 110373
with 110381
the 110387
South 110391
and 110394
the 110406
personal 110410
alliances 110425
by 110465
marriage 110482
made 110493
a 110509
ground 110517
of 110533
sympathy 110538
which 110547
had 110558
noticeable 110564
effects 110570
There 110574
were 110578
two 110600

The 110815

were 111111
very 111115

in 111138
their 111142
defiance 111159
of 111163
the 111170

Burnside 111432

been 111481
impressed 111484
with 111514
this 111543
condition 111547
of 111551
things 111559
from 111572
the 111576
day 111584
he 111612
assumed 111622
command 111631
His 111645
predecessor 111652
had 111662
struggled 111665
with 111679
it 111689
without 111709
satisfactory 111712

It 111728
was 111751
doubtless 111766
impossible 111791
to 111794
do 111811
more 111817
than 111831
diminish 111839
and 111849
restrain 111853
the 111856
evil 111859
which 111873
was 111877
the 111897
most 111906
annoying 111920
of 111924

his 112201
arrival 112204
in 112212
Cincinnati 112272
Burnside 112305
was 112309
so 112333
convinced 112338
of 112341
the 112348
widespread 112358

multiform 112367
activity 112389
of 112403
the 112411
disloyal 112414

he 112443
tried 112449

It 115604
was 115630
no 115644
doubt 115653
true 115671
that 115677
the 115684
Confederate 115705
authorities 115714
had 115717
constant 115729
correspondence 115742
with 115748
people 115752
in 115761
the 115765
Northern 115777
States 115787
and 115793
that 115797
systematic 115888
means 115907
were 115913
used 115917
to 115922
pass 115938
information 115948
and 115975
contraband 115978

and 116064
percussion 116086
caps 116095
among 116117
ordnance 116131
stores 116170
were 116180
the 116198
things 116201
they 116204
most 116213
coveted 116224
and 116228
dealers 116235
in 116244
these 116249
carried 116252
on 116260
their 116265
trade 116270
under 116286
pretence 116289
of 116292
being 116297
spies 116300
for 116303
each 116305
side 116311
in 116315
turn 116321
But 116328
besides 116336
these 116342
who 116356
were 116362
merely 116372
mercenary 116384
there 116391
were 116400
men 116402
and 116413
women 116417
who 116429
were 116437
honestly 116440
fanatical 116458
in 116462
their 116469
devotion 116472
to 116475
the 116478
Confederate 116481
cause 116488
The 116522
women 116528
were 116534
especially 116537
troublesome 116562
for 116571
they 116579
often 116605
seemed 116614
to 116644
court 116648
martyrdom 116656
They 116663
practised 116672
on 116682
our 116685
forbearance 116703
to 116712
the 116726
last 116743
degree 116768
for 116809
they 116813
knew 116843
our 116858
extreme 116868
unwillingness 116878
to 116881
deal 116889
harshly 116908
with 116928
any 116947
of 116954
their 116965
sex 116968
Personally 116980
I 116992
rated 117000
the 117016
value 117027
of 117055
spies 117059
and 117066
informers 117077
very 117081
low 117090
and 117099
my 117106
experience 117109
had 117114
made 117124
me 117146
much 117159
more 117168
prone 117171
to 117177
contempt 117180
than 117183
to 117194
fear 117203
of 117213
them 117219
But 117224
examples 117228
had 117233
to 117241
be 117244
made 117250
occasionally 117267
a 117282
few 117286
men 117297
were 117302
punished 117307
a 117316
few 117328
women 117342
who 117351
belonged 117369
in 117377
the 117386
South 117390
were 117393
sent 117400
through 117404
the 117419
lines 117425
and 117428
we 117437
reduced 117446
to 117479
its 117482
lowest 117493
practical 117503
terms 117516
an 117520
evil 117526
and 117530
nuisance 117536
which 117550
we 117562
could 117572
not 117578
wholly 117582
cure 117588
The 117593
best 117596
remedy 117606
for 117623
these 117627
plots 117644
and 117649
disturbances 117686
at 117699
the 117713
rear 117717
always 117741
was 117748
to 117755
keep 117769
the 117788
enemy 117791
busy 117799
by 117857
a 117860
vigorous 117863
aggressive 117869
at 117876
the 117895
front 117906
We 117992
kept 118037
however 118052
a 118079
species 118082
of 118087
provost 118107
court 118111
pretty 118143
actively 118156
at 118167
work 118183
and 118186
one 118195
or 118205
two 118215
officers 118224
were 118296
assigned 118309
to 118312
judge-advocate's 118343
duty 118366
who 118395
ran 118407
these 118424
courts 118433
under 118437
a 118445
careful 118481
supervision 118484
to 118487
make 118499
sure 118502
that 118510
they 118515
should 118523
not 118540
fall 118544
into 118574
indiscretions 118577
So 118604
long 118607
as 118613
the 118620
hand 118628
of 118633
military 118647
power 118673
was 118677
laid 118715
only 118734
on 118753
private 118758
persons 118769
who 118772
were 118776
engaged 118835
in 118857
overt 118863
acts 118903
of 118911
giving 118925
aid 118928
and 118932
comfort 118949
to 118955
the 118963
rebellion 118967
in 118983
the 118986
ways 118991
specified 119006
in 119024
Order 119034
No 119037
there 119040
was 119058
little 119068
criticism 119080
But 119083
the 119086
time 119090
came 119101
when 119104
General 119127
Burnside 119134
seemed 119149
to 119199
be 119220
challenged 119223
by 119244
a 119252
public 119276
character 119309
of 119312
no 119326
little 119358
prominence 119399
to 119409
enforce 119451
his 119455
order 119460
against 119464
him 119470
The 119481
Vallandigham 119488
case 119499
became 119504
the 119524
sensation 119533
of 119546
the 119558
day 119564
and 119567
acquired 119585
a 119638
singular 119666
historical 119686
importance 119714
The 119724
noise 119727
which 119732
was 119743
made 119755
about 119760
it 119774
seemed 119802
to 119836
create 119840
a 119866
current 119875
opinion 119894
that 119900
Burnside's 119914
action 119917
was 119924
a 119927
new 119941
departure 119944
and 119947
that 119969
his 119975
Order 120039
No 120048
was 120062
issued 120067
wholly 120079
on 120093
his 120102
own 120117
responsibility 120135
This 120162
was 120191
not 120194

Ohio 127960

lived 127978
at 127981

was 127995

saturnine 128018

in 128245

was 128264
the 128269

in 128301

to 128385
the 128395
administration 128399
of 128411
Mr 128440
Lincoln 128445
and 128448
a 128462
bitter 128465
opponent 128468
of 128473
the 128476
war 128479
He 128501
would 128504
have 128523
prevented 128539
the 128546
secession 128565
of 128572
the 128580
Southern 128586
States 128590
by 128599
yielding 128625
all 128628
they 128648
demanded 128662
for 128666
he 128678
agreed 128681
with 128692
them 128738
in 128749
thinking 128776
that 128788
their 128798
demands 128801
for 128821
the 128824
recognition 128849
of 128855
the 128868
constitutional 128876
inviolability 128891
of 128904
the 128920
slave 128923
system 128926
were 128976
just 128998
After 129022
the 129032
war 129039
began 129049
he 129074
still 129078
advocated 129081
peace 129116
at 129119
any 129122
price 129154
and 129157
vehemently 129164
opposed 129167
every 129170
effort 129176
to 129187
subdue 129192
the 129213
rebellion 129237
To 129240
his 129262
mind 129274
the 129277
war 129282
was 129305
absolutely 129310
unconstitutional 129314
on 129324
the 129352
part 129359
of 129376
the 129384
national 129392
government 129399
and 129422
he 129427
denounced 129440
it 129455
as 129467
tyranny 129481
and 129554
usurpation 129561
His 129578
theory 129613
seemed 129667
to 129673
be 129706
that 129717
if 129804
the 129818
South 129823
were 129830
let 129848
alone 129851
a 129880
reconstruction 129894
of 129911
the 129925
Union 129929
could 129935
be 129944
satisfactorily 129958
effected 129969
by 129982
squelching 129999
the 130010
anti-slavery 130020
agitation 130023
and 130030
that 130040
the 130045
Western 130099
States 130118
at 130121
any 130171
rate 130220
would 130224
find 130227
their 130242
true 130245
interest 130247
in 130261
uniting 130264
with 130271
the 130281
South 130290
even 130336
if 130350
the 130354
other 130377
Northern 130386
States 130406
should 130471
refuse 130475
to 130499
do 130528
so 130545
Beyond 130576
all 130596
question 130609
he 130614
answered 130620
to 130648
the 130663
old 130667
description 130671
of 130675
a 130699
Northern 130705
man 130722
with 130736
Southern 130773
principles 130796
and 130832
his 130854
violence 130860
of 130930
temper 130967
made 130977
it 130984
all 130991
a 131010
matter 131037
of 131091
personal 131114
hatred 131120
with 131125
him 131133
in 131136
his 131145
opposition 131153
to 131161
the 131173
leaders 131176
of 131180
the 131198
party 131247
in 131254
power 131258
at 131261
the 131266
North 131308
His 131338
denunciations 131348
were 131354
the 131360
most 131386
extreme 131390
and 131407
his 131444
expressions 131447
of 131456
contempt 131461
and 131489
ill-will 131496
were 131523
wholly 131563
unbridled 131576
He 131590
claimed 131594
of 131601
course 131630
that 131638
he 131641
kept 131652
within 131655
the 131659
limits 131663
of 131670
a 131672
constitutional 131677
opposition 131683
because 131731
he 131734
did 131756
not 131762
in 131772
terms 131778
advise 131782
his 131797
hearers 131802
to 131824
combine 131836
in 131842
armed 131861
opposition 131867

were 132271
noted 132275
down 132280

by 132301
a 132305

who 132350
was 132353

on 132369
leave 132388
of 132395
absence 132398
from 132410
the 132414

was 132459
corroborated 132462
by 132469
other 132472
reputable 132475
witnesses 132481
He 132497
charged 132503
the 132506
administration 132520
with 132524
designing 132528
to 132537
erect 132546
a 132549
despotism 132554
with 132564
refusing 132571
to 132576
restore 132587
the 132598
Union 132603
when 132615
it 132619
might 132626
be 132638
done 132647
with 132660
carrying 132663
on 132666
the 132672
war 132705
for 132725
the 132732
liberation 132781
of 132812
the 132831
blacks 132835
and 132841
the 132851
enslavement 132858
of 132870
the 132883
whites 132887
He 132890
declared 132894
that 132907
the 132933
provost-marshals 132952
for 132957
the 132963
congressional 132982
districts 133019
were 133054
intended 133077
to 133097
restrict 133103
the 133106
liberties 133116
of 133119
the 133131
people 133171
that 133177
courts-martial 133184
had 133197
already 133222
usurped 133225
power 133241
to 133251
try 133255
citizens 133273
contrary 133276
to 133286
law 133296
that 133309
he 133318
himself 133333
would 133345
never 133350
submit 133354
to 133362
the 133365
orders 133368
of 133396
a 133409
military 133414
dictator 133430
and 133440
such 133451
were 133465
Burnside 133476
and 133487
his 133492
subordinates 133514
that 133518
if 133547
those 133550
in 133573
authority 133591
were 133596
allowed 133624
to 133641
accomplish 133648
their 133651
purposes 133657
the 133660
people 133680
would 133683
be 133695
deprived 133716
of 133726
their 133731
liberties 133751
and 133755
a 133765
monarchy 133768
established 133780
Such 133783
and 133799
like 133817
expressions 133820
varied 133839
by 133848
trampling 133860
under 133863
his 133871
feet 133904
Order 133916
No 133941
etc 133969
made 133978
the 133989
staple 133992
of 134023
his 134026
incendiary 134032
speech 134039
When 134048
the 134051
report 134076
was 134109
made 134124
to 134139
Burnside 134165
and 134180
he 134209
had 134216
satisfied 134221
himself 134224
of 134228
its 134237
substantial 134248
truth 134254
he 134259
promptly 134282
accepted 134304
the 134317
challenge 134321
to 134328
test 134338
the 134354
legality 134383
of 134410
his 134417
order 134423
and 134435
directed 134439
the 134458
arrest 134500
of 134519
Mr 134523
Vallandigham 134588
It 134595
was 134604
characteristic 134613
of 134616
him 134629
that 134632
he 134654
did 134687
not 134731
consult 134740
with 134748
his 134751
subordinates 134807
or 134814
with 134818
lawyers 134823
He 134842
did 134866
not 134896
even 134906
act 134913
through 134927
my 134940
district 134984
organization 134986
but 134993
sent 135033
his 135047
own 135077
aide-de-camp 135080
with 135089
a 135109
guard 135123
to 135127
make 135136
the 135147
arrest 135173
at 135183
Dayton 135190
My 135237
recollection 135251
is 135280
that 135289
I 135309
did 135312
not 135315
know 135318
of 135332
the 135371
purpose 135374
till 135404
it 135416
was 135492
accomplished 135496
His 135504
reason 135507
for 135520
direct 135523
action 135528
no 135531
doubt 135559
was 135563
that 135575
if 135586
there 135602
were 135622
many 135634
links 135647
in 135661
the 135665
chain 135710
of 135719
routine 135736
there 135824
were 135835
multiplied 135850
chances 135854
of 135890
failure 135896
He 135924
did 135934
not 135965
want 136005
to 136022
be 136025
baffled 136028
in 136036
the 136041
arrest 136047
or 136065
to 136068
give 136080
the 136088
opportunity 136114
for 136165
raising 136171
a 136180
mob 136219
which 136229
there 136246
would 136257
be 136262
if 136306
his 136316
purposes 136326
were 136332
to 136351
become 136364
known 136368
in 136385
advance 136390
The 136410
arrest 136438
was 136449
made 136455
in 136460
the 136475
early 136480

The 138167
character 138179
of 138207
the 138212
whole 138218

was 138240
very 138255
high 138264
for 138268

and 138298
standing 138310
Before 138323

was 138363
arraigned 138380
on 138384
the 138392
charge 138396
of 138399
publicly 138421
expressing 138425

to 138652
weaken 138676
the 138679

of 138704

in 138755

as 139003
his 139030
counsel 139034
and 139065
then 139072
adopted 139108
the 139114
course 139142
of 139148
protesting 139151
against 139155
the 139169
jurisdiction 139174
of 139188
the 139191
court 139212
and 139218
against 139223
the 139237
authority 139271
for 139276
his 139283
arrest 139286
His 139291
grounds 139299
were 139312
that 139315
he 139327
was 139354
not 139384
amenable 139387
to 139396
any 139414
military 139419
jurisdiction 139422
and 139433
that 139436
his 139455
public 139492
speech 139507
did 139518
not 139540
constitute 139544
an 139550
offence 139577
known 139594
to 139597
the 139610
Constitution 139631
and 139644
laws 139656
To 139659
avoid 139676
the 139698
appearance 139713
of 139717
waiving 139725
the 139735
question 139802
of 139817
jurisdiction 139835
his 139845
counsel 139850
did 139900
not 139903
appear 139917
though 139957
offered 139973
the 140017
opportunity 140032
to 140121
do 140145
so 140161
and 140223
Mr 140251
Vallandigham 140276
cross-examined 140297
the 140327
witnesses 140345
himself 140403
and 140446
called 140455
those 140464
who 140480
testified 140489
for 140522
him 140540
The 140550
question 140553
of 140559
fact 140565
raised 140571
by 140579
him 140607
was 140618
that 140651
he 140666
had 140670
not 140673
advised 140691
forcible 140694
resistance 140708
to 140714
the 140717
government 140768
but 140809
had 140816
urged 140819
action 140824
at 140836
the 140863
elections 140875
by 140883
defeating 140893
the 140917
party 140933
in 140970
power 140980
at 140994
the 141000
polls 141037
That 141047
he 141050
did 141073
not 141077
in 141132
terms 141140
advocate 141143

the 141242
judge 141250
advocate 141279
of 141293
the 141304
court 141307
but 141310
the 141325
commission 141331
were 141341
persuaded 141344
that 141350
the 141362
effect 141367
of 141407
his 141418
speech 141440
was 141446
intended 141464
and 141476
well 141487
calculated 141490
to 141501
be 141514
incendiary 141529
and 141559
to 141583
arouse 141592
any 141607
kind 141610
of 141614
outbreak 141642
in 141654
sympathy 141664
with 141683
the 141691
armed 141708
enemies 141727
of 141733
the 141735

beyond 144678
our 144696

his 144784
return 144792
within 144837
our 144901
line 144921
he 144937

kept 144972
in 144974
close 144981
custody 144992
for 144996
the 145004
term 145045
specified 145052
in 145057
his 145070
sentence 145073
This 145077
was 145104
done 145108
accordingly 145121
The 145134
Confederate 145138
officials 145144
adopted 145160
a 145163
careful 145183
policy 145214
of 145218
treating 145231
him 145240
courteously 145258
without 145265
acknowledging 145290
that 145300
he 145324
was 145353
one 145356
of 145372
themselves 145377
and 145383
facilities 145389
were 145393
given 145414
him 145428
for 145449
running 145456
the 145471
blockade 145475
and 145490
reaching 145506
Canada 145527
There 145560
he 145563
established 145578
himself 145582
on 145621
the 145632
border 145674
and 145696
put 145701
himself 145713
in 145763
communication 145772
with 145783
his 145844
followers 145847
in 145881
Ohio 145886
by 145933
whom 145936
he 145942
was 145973
soon 145976
nominated 145994
for 146013
the 146045
Governorship 146048
of 146060
the 146066
State 146084
The 146088
case 146110
of 146113
course 146118
excited 146123
great 146136
public 146149
interest 146177
and 146184
was 146186
no 146207
doubt 146217
the 146223
occasion 146232
of 146235
considerable 146246
embarrassment 146252
to 146281
the 146291
administration 146298
Mr 146302
Lincoln 146313
dealt 146338
with 146356
it 146368
with 146373
all 146377
that 146381
shrewd 146398
practical 146410
judgment 146438
for 146445
which 146452
he 146455
was 146460
so 146462
remarkable 146470
and 146473
in 146479
the 146483
final 146489
result 146511
it 146523
worked 146528
to 146550
the 146566
political 146592
advantage 146601
of 146605
the 146616
National 146628
cause 146642
Sending 146645
Vallandigham 146652
beyond 146660
the 146666
lines 146708
took 146717
away 146732
from 146746
him 146752
the 146772
personal 146784
sympathy 146819
which 146822
might 146833
have 146841
been 146845
aroused 146848
had 146857
he 146863
been 146880
confined 146889
in 146893
one 146926
of 146939
the 146944
casemates 146953
of 146969
Fort 146976
Warren 146990
and 147001
put 147006
upon 147011
him 147016
an 147039
indelible 147048
badge 147074
of 147084
connection 147088
with 147113
the 147129
enemies 147142
of 147148
the 147162
country 147168
The 147180
cautious 147198
action 147212
of 147218
the 147222
Confederates 147234
in 147249
regard 147251
to 147254
him 147257
did 147287
not 147291
tend 147305
to 147316
remove 147340
this 147343
for 147353
it 147388
was 147394
very 147399
apparent 147405
that 147416
they 147419
really 147432
regarded 147437
him 147458
as 147461
a 147469
friend 147499
and 147502
helped 147590
him 147595
on 147633
his 147661
way 147664
to 147690
Canada 147695
in 147706
the 147717
expectation 147768
that 147775
he 147798
would 147803
prove 147817
a 147821
thorn 147824
in 147830
Mr 147837
Lincoln's 147841
side 147856
The 147882
President's 147885
proposal 147916
to 147919
the 147929
leading 147942
politicians 147946
who 147953
applied 147987
to 147996
him 147999
to 148037
rescind 148047
the 148087
sentence 148093
that 148103
as 148106
a 148120
condition 148123
of 148138
this 148146
they 148149
should 148154
make 148158
certain 148169
declarations 148190
of 148199
the 148207
duty 148226
to 148229
support 148257
the 148260
government 148267
in 148277
a 148286
vigorous 148290
prosecution 148294
of 148298
the 148302
war 148326
was 148330
a 148349
most 148352
telling 148355
bit 148371
of 148384
policy 148390
on 148401
his 148404
part 148410
and 148413
took 148423
the 148432
sting 148445
entirely 148452
out 148461
of 148464
the 148495
accusations 148506
of 148512
tyranny 148536
and 148557
oppression 148587
It 148591
must 148598
be 148608
admitted 148671
however 148730
that 148734
the 148737
case 148754
was 148756
one 148763
in 148768
which 148803
the 148834
administration 148837
ought 148852
to 148861
have 148876
left 148879
Burnside 148885
wholly 148899
untrammelled 148905
in 148930
carrying 148965
out 148968
the 148974
proclamation 148977
of 149003
September 149010
or 149019
should 149029
have 149038
formulated 149066
a 149074
rule 149079
for 149082
its 149086
military 149089
officers 149110
so 149122
that 149149
they 149165
would 149196
have 149217
acted 149220
only 149228
in 149231
accordance 149302
with 149310
the 149313
wishes 149316
of 149322
the 149331
government 149366
and 149369
in 149376
cases 149383
where 149397
the 149415
full 149418
responsibility 149433

be 149444
assumed 149459

When 149507

them 153571
to 153588
Washington 153600
asking 153610
for 153624
specific 153633
instructions 153651
The 153662
subject 153674
called 153677
for 153684
directions 153689
which 153702
would 153707
be 153710
applicable 153714
in 153743
all 153749
the 153753
military 153764
departments 153773
which 153799
included 153806
States 153810
out 153815
of 153828
the 153832
theatre 153835
of 153840
active 153863
warlike 153867
operations 153873
and 153878
such 153884
general 153895
directions 153899
should 153906
be 153917
given 153920
by 153923
the 153932
government 153953
But 153969
Burnside 153975
was 153979
apt 153982
to 153993
act 154002
impulsively 154016
and 154019
his 154024
impulse 154027
was 154032
to 154035
follow 154043
the 154049
bent 154058
of 154060
his 154072
ardent 154076
patriotism 154084
He 154087
was 154092
stirred 154095
to 154098
burning 154106
wrath 154109
by 154122
what 154155
seemed 154191
to 154201
him 154220
an 154223
intent 154237
to 154243
give 154264
aid 154270
and 154274
comfort 154280
to 154286
the 154301
rebellion 154316
and 154319
meant 154325
to 154359
punish 154375
such 154384
conduct 154398
without 154402
stopping 154409
to 154423
ask 154428
what 154440
complications 154446
might 154458
come 154482
of 154485
it 154491
I 154504
had 154519
found 154522
it 154534
desirable 154538
to 154555
form 154561
a 154564
judgment 154585
of 154594
my 154613
own 154633
with 154648
reference 154659
to 154667
the 154706
extent 154709
or 154729
limitation 154736
of 154739
military 154769
authority 154791
in 154799
the 154813
actual 154828
circumstances 154853
and 154886
I 154894
quote 154900
the 154947
form 154956
in 154960
which 154969
I 154983
then 154988
cast 155000
it 155007
so 155013
that 155020
I 155025
may 155044
not 155047
seem 155054
to 155081
be 155103
giving 155109
opinions 155112
formed 155118
after 155127
my 155134
own 155139
military 155146
duties 155152
were 155169
ended 155175
I 155180
concluded 155188
First 155195
That 155207
martial 155211
law 155241
operates 155251
either 155266
by 155282
reason 155287
of 155309
its 155337
proclamation 155345
by 155357
competent 155361
authority 155379
or 155392
ex 155395
necessitate 155404
rei 155410
in 155418
the 155429
immediate 155433
theatre 155436
of 155446
military 155449
operations 155461
Second 155497
That 155504
when 155509
the 155516
struggle 155523
is 155555
in 155559
the 155570
nature 155573
of 155578
a 155585
revolution 155595
and 155612
so 155617
long 155623
as 155627
the 155640
attempted 155645
revolution 155649
is 155657
in 155661
active 155672
progress 155676
no 155690
definite 155693
limits 155707
can 155710
be 155721
given 155724
to 155734
the 155741
'theatre 155745
of 155752
operations 155756
but 155763
the 155768
administration 155771
must 155778
be 155787
regarded 155790
as 155808
possessing 155815
a 155818
limited 155833
discretionary 155839
power 155846
in 155861
the 155874
use 155877
of 155898
martial 155906
law 155917
As 155931
to 155944
the 155953
practical 155961
application 155969
of 155979
this 156018
power 156040
the 156044
presumptions 156047
are 156052
always 156065
in 156069
favor 156087
of 156129
the 156147
established 156165
civil 156174
law 156186
of 156196
the 156201
land 156206
whenever 156209
and 156218
wherever 156229
it 156232
has 156241
a 156244
reasonable 156266
chance 156275
of 156278
unobstructed 156293
operation 156305
In 156329
a 156333
State 156356
or 156383
portion 156386
of 156399
the 156404
country 156422
not 156437
the 156443
theatre 156449
of 156459
actual 156477
fighting 156486
and 156505
where 156512
the 156517
civil 156546
courts 156569
are 156602
actually 156607
organized 156624
and 156627
working 156633
there 156636
must 156639
be 156680
some 156683
strong 156687
reason 156713
for 156725
sending 156730
criminals 156741
or 156752
State 156756
prisoners 156760
before 156786
a 156823
military 156826
tribunal 156840
such 156849
as 156883
that 156901
the 156905
government 156915
had 156920
reason 156968
to 156984
believe 156987
that 157003
a 157007
conspiracy 157011
was 157018
so 157026
powerful 157040
as 157058
to 157061
make 157079
an 157090
actual 157102
present 157113
danger 157136
of 157141
its 157165
overthrowing 157242
the 157273
loyal 157284
governments 157296
in 157305
some 157320
of 157330
the 157340
States 157354
before 157372
the 157391
civil 157420
courts 157446
could 157461
act 157468
in 157477
the 157487
ordinary 157518
process 157566
of 157584
business 157593
In 157597
such 157612
a 157619
case 157629
the 157633
arrest 157641
and 157684
admission 157692
to 157700
bail 157714
of 157722
the 157725
conspirators 157728
might 157735
be 157738
only 157759
the 157765
signal 157769
for 157784
their 157796
adherents 157815
to 157825
seize 157844
the 157863
reins 157881
of 157896
civil 157919
power 157938
overthrow 157946
the 157966
courts 157970
and 157981
consummate 157993
a 157997
revolution 158004
The 158011
quick 158016
and 158022
summary 158030
action 158034
of 158061
military 158097
power 158104
would 158107
then 158134
be 158137
the 158192
only 158198
thing 158201
which 158215
could 158223
avert 158226
the 158236
danger 158254
The 158260
justification 158270
of 158284
the 158292
use 158306
of 158330
a 158333
military 158359
tribunal 158364
depends 158370
on 158390
the 158404
existence 158410
of 158452
'probable 158463
cause' 158477
for 158493
believing 158518
the 158534
public 158538
danger 158542
to 158551
be 158554
great 158560
I 158566
see 158589
no 158597
reason 158602
to 158635
change 158673
the 158690
form 158696
of 158704
stating 158728
the 158741
principle 158744
I 158747
then 158759
adopted 158788
The 158812
limitations 158861
given 158877
it 158882
seem 158889
sufficient 158910
to 158925
secure 158937
proper 158940
caution 158958
in 158970
applying 158974
it 158982
and 159022
will 159028
show 159041
that 159046
I 159058
thought 159108
then 159116
as 159132
I 159142
do 159172
now 159186
that 159199
the 159213
administration 159218
ought 159221
to 159227
have 159237
laid 159250
down 159282
rules 159293
by 159296
which 159313
the 159362
commandants 159369
of 159393
military 159478
departments 159481
could 159491
be 159515
guided 159532
and 159535
which 159556
would 159605
have 159629
saved 159632
us 159635
from 159638
the 159659
weakness 159680
of 159686
acting 159786
with 159793
seeming 159798
vigor 159808
on 159831
one 159844
day 159906
only 159908
to 159941
retreat 159953
from 159957
our 159976
position 159979
the 159984
next 160003
In 160006
Vallandigham's 160020
case 160029
the 160051
common 160063
argument 160068
was 160075
used 160096
by 160153
his 160159
friends 160165
that 160183
he 160189
was 160192
not 160208
exceeding 160220
a 160271
lawful 160288
liberty 160291
of 160302
speech 160356
in 160361
political 160417
opposition 160427
to 160437
the 160442
administration 160451
When 160468
however 160474
a 160477
civil 160483
war 160489
is 160514
in 160522
progress 160527
it 160539
is 160574
simply 160580
a 160601
question 160609
of 160629
fact 160632
whether 160642
words 160665
used 160668
are 160678
intended 160689
to 160695
give 160697
aid 160711
and 160717
comfort 160757
to 160834
the 160836
enemy 160862
and 160882
are 160891
evidence 160899
of 160927
conspiracy 160938
with 160943
the 160959
public 160964
enemy 160970
If 160975
so 161000
it 161025
is 161039
too 161042
clear 161047
for 161064
argument 161067
that 161070
the 161074
overt 161098
acts 161102
of 161114
the 161117
enemy 161140
are 161188
brought 161204
home 161221
to 161248
all 161251
who 161283
combine 161286
and 161290
confederate 161304
with 161308
them 161318
and 161324
all 161333
are 161348
involved 161356
in 161367
the 161377
same 161381
responsibility 161387
This 161394
question 161426
of 161435
fact 161448
and 161461
intent 161484
was 161488
officially 161491
settled 161494
by 161504
the 161524
findings 161540
of 161559
the 161563
military 161577
court 161587
But 161592
there 161604
was 161614
another 161637
connection 161664
of 161675
the 161682
speech 161685
with 161694
overt 161704
acts 161710
which 161767
the 161770
public 161781
mind 161808
took 161815
firm 161868
hold 161872
of 161880
Among 161920
the 161949
most 161953
incendiary 161960
of 161966
Vallandigham's 161969
appeals 161972
had 161998
been 162007
those 162024
which 162032
urged 162037
the 162049
people 162056
to 162062
resist 162065
the 162068
provost-marshals 162088
in 162101
the 162114
several 162152
districts 162160
It 162180
is 162230
nonsense 162241
to 162245
say 162248
that 162258
resisting 162263
the 162304
draft 162307
or 162310
the 162319
arrest 162359
of 162363
deserters 162375
only 162397
meant 162400
voting 162410
for 162415
an 162428
opposition 162461
party 162472
at 162476
the 162480
elections 162495
There 162522
had 162530
been 162533
armed 162596
and 162604
organized 162616
resistance 162624
to 162693
arrest 162741
of 162744
deserters 162751
in 162787
Noble 162837
County 162858
just 162861
before 162872
his 162882
speech 162885
and 162890
soon 162893
after 162896
it 162906
there 162915
was 162938
a 162968
still 162980
more 162996
formidable 163049
armed 163067
organization 163079
with 163100
warlike 163120
action 163127
against 163147
the 163172
enrolling 163175
officers 163197
in 163223
Holmes 163226
County 163230
in 163255
the 163264
same 163283
region 163299
in 163321
which 163331
the 163334
speech 163345
was 163377
made 163405
This 163426
last 163431
took 163435
the 163445
form 163463
of 163492
an 163509
armed 163517
camp 163542
and 163558
the 163562
insurgents 163570
did 163585
not 163588
disperse 163591
till 163602
a 163623
military 163635
force 163638
was 163676
sent 163696
against 163711
them 163715
and 163737
attacked 163778
them 163801
in 163817
fortified 163832
lines 163839
where 163844
they 163847
used 163869
both 163874
cannon 163905
and 163922
musketry 163930
It 163952
did 163970
not 163982
seem 163992
plausible 163996
to 164001
the 164017
common 164029
sense 164034
of 164068
the 164095
people 164109
that 164127
we 164140
could 164145
properly 164149
charge 164152
with 164155
volleying 164168
musketry 164177
upon 164195
the 164212
barricades 164221
of 164230
the 164239
less 164243
intelligent 164246
dupes 164259
whilst 164288
the 164305
leader 164317
who 164341
had 164396
incited 164400
and 164408

to 166087

their 166115
legality 166118
The 166123
court 166134
dismissed 166161
his 166165
application 166172
on 166176
the 166194
ground 166202
that 166220
the 166224

all 166649
set 166659
forth 166662
in 166685
the 166705

that 166740
the 166747

was 167011
naturally 167015
accepted 167018
at 167023
the 167032

It 168755

that 168799
the 168820

more 168868

less 168887

Davis 169090
it 169100
went 169104
all 169109
lengths 169122
in 169154
holding 169160
that 169173
the 169183

work 176732

Carrington 176746

granted 177584

many 177617

had 177639
been 177644
active 177650
in 177654
the 177662
rebellion 177675
But 177705
Mr 177713
Johnson 177716
was 177723
so 177731
much 177738
hampered 177751
by 177761
his 177785
quarrel 177789
with 177802
Congress 177805
over 177825
reconstruction 177832
that 177835
he 177882
was 177888
disposed 177896
to 177909
avoid 177914
interference 177931
with 177938
criminal 177967
cases 177976
where 177984
his 178008
action 178061
could 178065
subject 178075
him 178098
to 178101
the 178113
charge 178117
of 178124
sympathy 178130
with 178148
the 178151
accused 178155
He 178176
carefully 178197
abstained 178208
from 178218
meddling 178235
with 178251
Jefferson 178302
Davis 178305
as 178314
he 178330
did 178358
with 178374
Milligan 178389
and 178393
left 178396
the 178399
responsibility 178411
with 178417
the 178446
courts 178466
The 178481
final 178505
development 178520
of 178526

investigation 178553
of 178560
the 178579
Society 178633
of 178643
the 178650
Golden 178674

took 178687
place 178695
after 178705
I 178713
had 178717
again 178722
obtained 178740
a 178747
field 178760
command 178783

I 178805
was 178809
glad 178816
to 178823
have 178835
no 178841

to 178847
form 178860

collected 178965
by 178981
means 178999
of 179014
detectives 179017
depends 179022
so 179025
greatly 179038
on 179046
the 179050
character 179088
of 179100
the 179106
men 179109
employed 179113
and 179120
the 179127
instructions 179131
under 179135
which 179150
they 179182
act 179187

one 179200
may 179204
well 179217
suspend 179222
judgment 179229
unless 179234
he 179237
has 179256
more 179269
than 179296
ordinarily 179301
full 179309
knowledge 179317
on 179329
these 179332
points 179346
The 179349
findings 179367
of 179373
the 179376
military 179380
commission 179383
must 179387
stand 179396
as 179438
a 179446
prima 179451

historical 179486
determination 179494
of 179511
the 179516
facts 179521
it 179525
reported 179528
and 179532
the 179550
burden 179557
of 179571
proof 179619
is 179629
fairly 179632
upon 179640
those 179647
who 179685
assert 179690
that 179701
the 179707
conclusions 179739
were 179742
not 179745
sustained 179749
by 179770
trustworthy 179787
evidence 179793
I 179797
have 179802
mentioned 179843
the 179869
open 179874
resistance 179963
to 179971
the 179994
draft 180048

the 180097

in 180167
Noble 180174

Holmes 180215

The 180239
first 180246
of 180262
these 180279
was 180283
scarcely 180286
more 180289
than 180304
a 180307
petty 180310
riotous 180313
demonstration 180331
which 180348
melted 180358
away 180386
before 180392
the 180395
officers 180398
as 180403
soon 180424
as 180427
they 180438
were 180445
able 180463
to 180483
show 180491
that 180494
they 180513

and 181162
the 181168
sake 181172

to 181704
make 181708

resistance 181737
hopeless 181781
The 181798

maintained 181812
a 181815
bold 181842
face 181847

the 181872
troops 181886
were 181915
close 181938
upon 181970
them 181984
but 182029
when 182039
they 182069
saw 182072
a 182099
strong 182110
line 182113
of 182117
infantry 182157
charging 182169
up 182173

the 182243

they 182366
had 182370
made 182376
their 182385
camp 182388
and 182408
heard 182411
the 182445
whistling 182449
of 182454
bullets 182457
from 182463
the 182509
skirmishers 182517
their 182569
courage 182584
gave 182594
way 182603
and 182623
they 182633
fled 182648
every 182668
man 182689
for 182709
himself 182754
Only 182780
two 182786
or 182807
three 182817
were 182820
seriously 182872
wounded 182892

the 7772

speak 15155
as 15253

our 16331

without 17353
reserve 17363
We 17764
are 17994
hopeful 18022
I 19161

refused 23729

his 24930

will 25550
take 25725

that 25775
their 26106

will 26125
be 26130
so 26567
modified 27395
that 27401
there 27458
may 27483
be 27505
no 27510
occasion 27532
to 27540
make 27597
many 27760
more 27827
arrests 27986
I 28160
am 28919
persuaded 28929
that 30014
our 30495
policy 30923
should 30978
be 32141
to 32406
repress 32426
disloyalty 32959
and 32962
sedition 33400
at 33498
home 33973
rather 34408
by 34449
punishment 35109

by 36175

a 142956

to 159139
Johnston 159329
whilst 159615
they 159693
nearly 159700
all 159789
have 160044
some 160350
knowledge 160421
of 160583
the 161537
diminution 161660
of 162120
the 162149
Confederate 162168

mentioned 163959
above 164008
most 164023

them 165626
answer 165955
that 166460
they 166732
do 167194
not 168424
think 168794
it 169050
a 169121

weakening 169407

of 171315
the 171417
inquiry 171463
put 171554
to 172045
them 172111
Some 172126
of 172393
them 172531
however 172782
say 173003
very 173282
naturally 173535
that 173621
as 174244
the 174443
secret 174943
service 175123
is 175683
managed 175742
from 175902
headquarters 176201
and 176296
all 176363
the 176915
information 177127
received 177391
is 177688
forwarded 177795
there 177848
General 178537
Rosecrans 178558
should 178930
be 178943
much 179575
better 179608
able 179767
to 179885
answer 180230
this 180366
question 180814
than 181891
his 182056
subordinates 182270
As 182420
to 182472
the 182655
second 182705
part 182717
of 182796
that 182827
question 182855
nearly 182875
all 182895
seem 182945
to 183002
assume 183027
that 183053
the 183194
battle 183214
would 183218
be 183257
in 183290
the 183304
nature 183434
of 183611
a 183628
direct 183637
attack 183656
on 183663
the 183698
fortifications 183915
at 184103
Shelbyville 184139
and 184306
are 184398
not 184542
sanguine 184601
of 184611
a 184639
successful 184678
result 184725
The 133609
few 154366
who 15873
speak 59148
of 181186
turning 9763
manoeuvres 18246
feel 24946
that 48526
the 61206
further 62249
retreat 68648
of 102184
Bragg 121550
would 134559
only 134576
lengthen 139280
their 140176
own 149334
line 163208
of 180720
communications 149263
and 2559
do 5064
no 5105
good 7232
Strangely 8689
too 10188
they 10957
argue 11124
many 13124
of 15781
them 17919
that 18059
an 21382
advance 21406
would 22246
not 23372
prevent 24635
further 24734
depletion 25265
of 26562
Bragg 29864
to 32993
strengthen 33631
Johnston 34557
They 36546
consequently 38862
and 38897
almost 41963
unanimously 41969
advise 43263
against 48134
an 49305
immediate 49405
or 50815
early 51049
advance 51636
It 56493
is 56895
instructive 58836
to 58914
compare 61250
these 62086
opinions 62848
with 63412
the 64882
actual 65507
facts 69037
The 69124
inaction 70271
of 75036
the 75398
summer 83525
had 83566
led 83660
directly 84172
to 84624
the 88102
detachment 88427
of 89368
two 89661
divisions 93469
of 95987
infantry 96005
and 97612
artillery 98810
and 98834
one 109900
of 109904
cavalry 110460
to 110568
reinforce 117501
Johnston 118751
just 119204
as 119808
the 120526
inactivity 120849
of 121089
Meade 123164
later 123729
in 123743
the 124512
season 124718
encouraged 129730
the 130181
Richmond 132644
government 137203
to 138288
send 140475
Longstreet 144118
to 144718
Bragg 144990
from 145179
Virginia 145271
If 146144
Rosecrans 146739
had 149126
moved 149291
early 151214
in 151391
the 153309
season 153658
not 153778
only 155426
must 156737
Bragg 157288
have 160532
kept 163183
his 170778
army 175563
intact 176461
but 177772
the 180478
battle 5149
of 5289
Chickamauga 5766
if 5985
fought 9307
at 9713
all 9824
must 11194
have 11625
been 12129
decided 12473
without 14567
Longstreet 16998
and 17051
therefore 17871
most 20786
probably 21963
with 23390
brilliant 26707
success 31879
for 33486
our 34067
arms 36684
It 37576
was 37762
delay 38692
in 42277
advancing 44782
both 52485
in 53567
Tennessee 53731
and 55107
in 57391
Virginia 58001
that 58064
thus 58869
directly 59230
led 61106
to 61733
disaster 61762
If 62149
a 65294
brilliant 71067
victory 72971
at 73262
Chickamauga 73719
had 74822
been 77684
coincident 78740
with 78904
the 80516

of 81791
Vicksburg 82316
and 82474
Lee's 83548
defeat 84705
at 85746

it 89502
does 91177
not 94199
seem 95486
rash 98981
to 99045
believe 100222
that 100944
the 101171
collapse 102225
of 106213
the 107175
Confederacy 107747
would 108493

to 137849
such 140064
distinction 144677
that 148663
their 150516

are 153762

of 165791

mental 173380
character 173512
and 177698
gauging 179181
their 179289
development 180830
Sheridan 3712
answered 4561
briefly 7157
that 9666
he 10696
believed 14596
Bragg 18474
had 19263
no 19432
more 23264
than 24661
or 27469
infantry 36295
and 36761
artillery 39591
with 40892
a 44540
large 45968
cavalry 48607
force 49484
In 53106

close 66007
to 68789

A 40692
fair 40696
comparison 44369
between 46336
the 46558
Confederate 46971
and 47563
the 50433
National 52722
armies 53068
therefore 55777
demands 56035
a 56791
computation 59295
of 62546
numbers 65484
by 66612
the 68765
same 71153
method 71170
and 71193
as 71308
we 73918
did 76255
not 77568
use 78964
forms 80565
containing 80969
the 82354
Effective 83543
Total 84059
as 85278

the 88688
Confederates 88888

officers 100324
and 100475
men 100728
present 101029
for 101201
duty 101992
which 102855
are 104106
computed 104807
alike 104856
in 105650
the 105918
returns 105925
on 105944
both 106361
sides 106470
are 107320
the 107708
most 109186
satisfactory 113679
and 114325
fair 115421
basis 115942
of 117797
comparison 118539
He 121066
did 121340
not 121602
think 122566
Bragg 122856
would 124533
fight 126453
but 127336
would 127591
retreat 128637
and 130470
thought 132409
that 132906
in 133250
such 133632
a 134639
case 139346
he 139763
would 142682
not 148293
be 148426
hindered 150076
from 150529
sending 151415
more 152004
help 152147
to 153406
Johnston 157078
Again 158265
as 163720
forage 163873
in 164024
the 164258
country 165707
was 166061
scarce 168695
he 168863
voted 169467
against 169664
an 169919
early 171873
advance 172470
Thomas 173244
did 173292
not 173325
believe 173428
Bragg 174181
had 174263
been 174445
materially 176090
weakened 177007
for 177295
if 179221
any 179625
troops 179928
had 180423
been 180471
sent 181316
away 183523
he 183574
thought 17100
they 28538
had 132621
returned 134457
or 153599
their 176113
places 182375
had 184994
been 328
supplied 6120
He 21651
concluded 45132
that 48437
Bragg 62734
was 161013
ready 39940
to 53678
fight 182405
with 10953
an 22651
army 27048
at 53480
least 56307
as 74900
large 81494
as 84813
that 104732
of 172557
Rosecrans 33463
that 121022
to 130916
hold 80518
our 79794
army 8415
where 12025
it 79539
was 324
would 7807
sufficiently 16478
prevent 17185
further 17653
reduction 17856
of 29846
Bragg's 30517
that 31866
an 40450
advance 44441
would 48273
give 49223
the 51850
latter 54969
the 63881
advantage 64007
and 65632
was 66353
not 69782
advisable 69908
His 70567
preference 74899
for 74938
defensive 77205
warfare 77254
was 84840
very 85066
evident 86011
He 86124
said 87681
it 90010
was 90930
true 99857
that 100248
Bragg 100332
might 101773
be 103267
reinforced 104731
and 105018
take 108341
the 110055
initiative 110099
but 110335
that 112756
he 113395
should 114099
be 114231
most 117395
happy 121712
to 123874
meet 126450
him 130036
here 131395
with 134951
his 137685
reinforcements 138173
In 138195
conclusion 138549
he 139101
indicated 140623
the 141669
necessity 144832
of 146553
more 148365
cavalry 148914
to 149708
be 150509
added 152479
to 160256
the 163019
army 165468

When 87283
the 170789
answers 128260
were 147473
all 108150
received 155878
Garfield 170236
summed 119087
them 50262
up 139952
in 171140
a 171342
paper 130607
which 4680
must 4840
be 5077
admitted 5433
to 11201
be 11670
a 12806
remarkable 15597
production 15748
for 16726
a 17261
young 17448
volunteer 17533
officer 18995
deliberately 19737
controverting 20248
the 20485
opinions 20579
of 20663
such 20735
an 21137
array 21869
of 22757
seniors 24555
He 24693
gave 25670
as 26024
the 27059
best 27152
information 27228
at 27236
headquarters 27585
the 28773
force 29048
of 30250
Bragg 30792
before 31295
sending 32215
help 32314
to 34885
Johnston 34964
as 36114
infantry 36435
artillery 36583
and 36767
cavalry 37493
This 37661
made 40078
the 40860
infantry 42552
about 42568
too 43226
many 43783
the 45351
artillery 45371
nearly 46353
exactly 46417
right 46517
and 46531
the 46572
cavalry 46914
too 47343
many 47832
--on 48926
the 48950
whole 49024
a 49251
very 49328
close 49629
estimate 49666
From 49794
these 53172
he 67132
deducted 67592
which 67845
was 68347
right 68980
He 69347
stated 70744
Rosecrans's 71685
force 71800
at 72875
bayonets 73452
and 74067
sabres 74526
with 74655
about 74859
more 75560
on 75771
the 79224
way 79380
but 83270
deducted 83355
for 83390
necessary 87078
posts 87439
and 91111
garrisons 91477
The 92634
balancing 93741
showed 94809
to 95260
throw 95377
against 96380
Bragg's 96493
He 98247
further 98391
showed 98863
that 98888
delay 98895
would 100337
give 100997
time 102119
for 103404
the 103618
enemy's 104450
detachments 104477
to 105730
return 106578
whilst 107428
we 108058
could 108872
hope 108919
for 108975
no 109584
further 109966
increase 110303
during 110890
the 111670
rest 112451
of 113016
the 113029
season 113038
He 113308
then 114020
analyzed 116466
the 116791
military 117022
and 117296
civil 118543
reasons 119008
for 120168
activity 123256
declared 125140
that 125264
he 127620
believed 128919
we 129810
could 129845
be 131557
victorious 134795
and 136113
that 137325
the 138479
administration 142357
and 145536
the 145902
country 145915
had 146254
the 146802
right 147071
to 147952
expect 148061
the 148551
army 150032
to 151121
try 153435
The 153883
result 155528
was 156882
a 159204
curious 162125
but 162373
encouraging 163295
result 164808
of 167240
bold 167636
and 167772
cogent 168233
reasoning 168442
Although 169281
Rosecrans 171453
reported 172154
to 177856
General 178043
Halleck 179552
on 179751

opinion 46561

the 67094
logic 92659
and 341
the 630
facts 4121
pressed 4882
upon 5002
him 5575
by 5712
his 5789
chief 5940
of 6159
staff 6217
evidently 7346
took 7411
strong 7879
hold 8008
of 8670
his 9215
active 9486
intellect 9596
so 9712
that 10818
when 11260
Halleck 12567
on 12721
the 14025
16th 14400
asked 14437
for 14642
a 15050
categorical 15957
answer 16019
whether 16678
he 18675
would 19585
make 20160
an 21677
immediate 23384
movement 24463
forward 24668
he 25058
replied 27202
If 27679
it 28323
means 32351
to-night 32708
or 34435
to-morrow 34852
no 34963
If 35363
it 35615
means 35671
as 35736
soon 36470
as 36799
all 36962
things 37619
are 38702
ready 40809

plain 55330
intimation 55540
that 56349

helped 63967
the 64288

it 71663
to 72309

negative 75623

personal 78023
advice 79956
and 80420
oral 80467
discussions 81417

a 92111

the 99054
campaign 101377
of 101439
turning 101683
manoeuvres 102930
which 103169
he 103266
devised 103405

adopted 105721
and 106835
as 106938
to 107099
its 108907
probable 108932
success 109840
The 109999
result 110212
is 110590
reckoned 110671
one 110757
of 110811
his 110841

claims 112390

Rosecrans's 146185
conduct 146629
of 146987
his 147037
campaign 148182
dated 148332
indeed 150367
much 151270
earlier 151399
than 152274
the 152355
time 154730
indicated 154749
He 155764
had 156004
succeeded 156808
Buell 158295
at 159143
the 159701
end 161023
of 161349
October 161410
when 161984
Bragg 162481
was 166225
in 168423
full 169001
retreat 170972
to 174116
the 174241
Tennessee 174291
River 175241
The 175274
continuance 176255
of 176561
a 177304
vigorous 177861
pursuit 177962
and 178908
the 179687
prompt 180339
reoccupation 181166
of 181843
the 182244
country 2621
held 147670
by 75147
us 13108
in 29667
the 43588
early 44937
summer 46467
was 48130
regarded 64545
as 65365
of 80736
the 85299
utmost 99363
importance 131708
for 143113
political 145823
quite 149666
as 28910
much 65276
as 90069
for 51700
military 63217
reasons 65121
It 65144
was 165960
not 47386
a 167515
time 61196
to 173
halt 187
and 206
reorganize 219
an 235
army 237
The 271
question 283
of 292
foreign 311
intervention 318
was 327
apparently 356
trembling 369
in 379
the 445
balance 462
and 469
to 503
let 516
European 518
powers 613
rest 698
under 721
the 779
belief 795
that 843
we 861
had 901
lost 1012
most 1081
of 1092
what 1100
had 1183
been 1203
gained 1266
in 1361
the 1422
advance 1438
from 1469
Donelson 1507
to 1514
Shiloh 1517
and 1524
Corinth 1537
was 1548
to 1552
invite 1571
complications 1642
of 1649
the 1690
most 1705
formidable 1800
character 1817
The 1896
Washington 1942
authorities 2012
had 2130
therefore 2166
a 2252
perfect 2269
right 2292
to 2302
decide 2325
that 2343
to 2351
press 2384
Bragg 2392
vigorously 2395
and 2528
without 2537
intermission 2631
was 2637
the 2639
imperative 2717
duty 2771
of 2777
the 2782
commander 2803
of 2823
the 2839
Army 2856
of 2863
the 2867
Cumberland 2871
He 2874
would 2906
be 2948
rightly 3012
held 3076
to 3080
have 3094
disappointed 3179
the 3207
expectations 3252
of 3296
his 3354
government 3373
if 3518
he 3525
failed 3529
to 3554
do 3611
so 3700
Rosecrans 3730
had 3737
been 3743
chosen 3753
to 3796
succeed 3844
Buell 3860
because 3878
of 3899
the 3912
belief 3926
that 4072
his 4081
character 4086
was 4094
one 4162
of 4195

gradually 25723
increased 25851
till 25854
midsummer 25889
when 25897
it 25930
reached 25969
a 25989
maximum 25999
of 26045
about 26071
and 26140
Rosecrans's 26224

to 26285
The 26319
Confederates 26363
had 26367
a 26422
larger 26461
proportion 26493
of 26504
cavalry 26540
than 26557
we 26566
but 26588
this 26624
was 26674
at 26710
the 26729
expense 26764
of 26795
being 26819
much 26876

the 26954

serious 27112

In 27165
fact 27205
this 27213
disproportion 27217
was 27246
another 27303
reason 27374
for 27440
active 27472
work 27488
since 27561
experience 27583
showed 27589
that 27605
the 27651
enemy 27665
kept 27787
his 27814
cavalry 27844
at 27864
home 27935

he 27991
was 27996
vigorously 28018
pushed 28025

sent 28077
them 28103

raids 28159
to 28183
interrupt 28203
our 28212
communications 28234
when 28359
we 28373
gave 28492
him 28517
a 28535
respite 28541
Our 28554
superiority 28635
in 28643
numbers 28683
was 28718
enough 28741
therefore 28759
to 28912
make 28917
it 28925
entirely 28976
reasonable 28979
and 29087
in 29228
accord 29276
with 29372
every 29394
sound 29464
rule 29647
of 29705
conducting 29743
war 29751

of 70894
General 70899
Burnside 70927
and 70951
his 71013
staff 71137
for 71165
active 71190
service 71231
in 71312
the 71315
field 71339
was 71363
quite 71394
an 71436
event 71486
in 71502
Cincinnati 71511
society 71527
The 71547
young 71609
men 71642
were 71649
a 71664
set 71671
of 71680
fine 71754
fellows 71760
well 71809
educated 71858
and 71879
great 71895
social 71928
favorites 71952
There 71980
was 72003
a 72025
public 72064
concert 72071
the 72079
evening 72088
before 72098
they 72115
left 72145
for 72192
Lexington 72205
and 72310
they 72338
were 72389
to 72398
go 72425
by 72439
a 72452
special 72510
train 72591
after 72617
the 72630
entertainment 72638
should 72700
be 72724
over 72757
They 72761
came 72773
to 72792
the 72803
concert 72826
hall 72850
therefore 72852
not 72872
only 72883
booted 72888
and 72902
spurred 72907
but 72917
there 72943
was 72951
perhaps 72975
a 73015
bit 73123
of 73162
youthful 73190
but 73193
very 73363
natural 73388
ostentation 73406
of 73415
being 73450
ready 73588
for 73684
the 73706
field 73714
Their 73799
hair 73807
was 73810
cropped 73817
as 73830
close 73841
as 73845
barber's 73855
shears 73944
could 73954
cut 73984
it 74053
they 74061
wore 74074
the 74094
regulation 74187
uniform 74213
of 74365
the 74435
cavalry 74469
with 74477
trim 74515
round-about 74520
jackets 74597
and 74610
were 74619
the 74625
cynosure 74629
of 74637
all 74649
eyes 74665
Their 74678
parting 74721
words 74787
were 74842
said 74849
to 74857
their 74889
lady 74967
friends 75012
in 75032
the 75065
intervals 75076
of 75079
the 75113
music 75184
and 75219
the 75221
pretty 75257
dramatic 75307
effect 75313
of 75382
it 75425
all 75434
suggested 75451
to 75457
an 75472
onlooker 75484
the 75540
famous 75568
parting 75597
scene 75664
in 75711
Belgium's 75750
capital 75755
which 75801
Childe 75811
Harold 75852
has 75863
made 75902
so 75989
familiar 75996
It 76023
was 76037
quite 76061
an 76095
anti-climax 76097
however 76123
when 76135
the 76183
gay 76236
young 76322
officers 76332
came 76346
back 76361
before 76380
a 76436
week 76454
was 76488
over 76501
crestfallen 76514
the 76521
detaching 76531
of 76535
the 76600
Ninth 76894
Corps 76905
having 76930
suspended 76968
operations 76976
in 76998
Kentucky 77013
They 77022
were 77074
a 77099
little 77138
quizzed 77157
about 77198
their 77303
very 77315
brief 77365
campaign 77368
but 77388
so 77403
good-humoredly 77449
that 77464
they 77469
bore 77531
it 77538
pretty 77570
well 77576
and 77618
were 77642
able 77704
to 77718
seem 77737
amused 77771
at 77794
it 77828
as 77834
well 77856
as 77896
the 77944
fair 77948
quizzers 77986
In 78024
preparation 78037
for 78052
a 78077
lengthened 78081
absence 78088
Burnside 78107
had 78120
turned 78136
over 78151
to 78175
me 78197
some 78200
extra 78223
duties 78249
He 78269
ordered 78318
the 78397
District 78414
of 78438
Michigan 78467
to 78472
be 78480
added 78491
to 78512
my 78562
command 78692
and 78767
gave 78788
general 78803
directions 78855
that 78861
the 78863
current 78872
business 78884
of 78898
the 78925
department 78939
headquarters 78945
should 78949
pass 78986
through 79049
my 79081
hands 79087
As 79098
General 79104
Parke 79125
his 79152
chief 79187
of 79190
staff 79203
had 79241
gone 79255
to 79365
Vicksburg 79372
in 79395
command 79403
of 79497
the 79548
Ninth 79608
Corps 79644
Burnside 79668
made 79692
informal 79755
use 79762
of 79880
me 79885
to 79893
supply 79905
in 79915
some 79925
measure 79932
his 79988
place 80030
Our 80066
relations 80068
therefore 80097
became 80154
closer 80158
than 80183
ever 80195
He 80207
hoped 80316
his 80318
troops 80351
would 80485
soon 80498
come 80609
back 80681
to 80689
him 80704
as 80746
was 80794
promised 80824
and 80839
in 80853
resuming 80862
business 80926
at 80942
the 81013
Cincinnati 81020
headquarters 81061
he 81076
tried 81120
to 81153
keep 81157
it 81181
all 81183
in 81195
such 81198
shape 81248
that 81252
he 81268
could 81361
drop 81369
it 81378
at 81380
a 81395
moment's 81469
notice 81486
To 81502
keep 81521
the 81566
enemy 81577
occupied 81583
he 81593
organized 81614
two 81618
expeditions 81626
one 81632
under 81639
Brigadier-General 81663
Julius 81666
White 81683

Colonel 81895
W 81917
P 81968
Sanders 81977
into 82005
East 82038
Tennessee 82111
The 82115
latter 82130
was 82156
one 82175
of 82183
the 82189
boldest 82242
and 82265
longest 82300
raids 82322
made 82336
during 82366
the 82370
war 82377
and 82392
besides 82403
keeping 82441
the 82467
enemy 82480
on 82483
the 82488
alert 82500
destroying 82513
considerable 82533
military 82573
stores 82581
and 82678
a 82686
number 82744
of 82795
important 82815

and 83131
the 83176
approaches 83178
to 83203
it 83364
through 83396
the 83518
mountains 83581
which 83624
was 83632
of 83672
great 83712
value 83721
a 83726
little 83737
later 83749
The 83759
force 83859
consisted 83862
of 83891
mounted 83903
men 83926
being 83956
detachments 83969
from 83978
different 83995
regiments 84001
of 84035

and 84100
mounted 84222
infantry 84279
among 84284
which 84291
were 84333
some 84336

a 84736
young 84746
officer 84770
of 84799
the 84854
regular 84864

who 84913
was 84928
now 84946
colonel 84994
of 84997
the 85005
Fifth 85086
Kentucky 85092
Cavalry 85097
He 85134
rapidly 85172
made 85213
a 85257
first-class 85323
reputation 85341
as 85493
a 85557
bold 85573
leader 85584
of 85591
mounted 85596
troops 85608
but 85615
was 85624
unfortunately 85646
killed 85657
in 85700
the 85703
defence 85705
of 85708
Knoxville 85737
in 85759
November 85778
of 85815
this 85822

rapidly 86395
southward 86422
sixty 86428
miles 86448
to 86456
Williamsburg 86486
where 86499
the 86550
Cumberland 86562
River 86582
was 86607
fordable 86639
Thence 86665
he 86706
moved 86779
southwest 86781
about 86800

Continuing 87073
this 87113
route 87141
southward 87158
some 87170
fifty 87278
miles 87300
more 87318
he 87333
struck 87387
the 87417
Big 87421

Tennessee 88052
having 88073
marched 88104
in 88116
all 88131
rather 88138
more 88153
than 88157
two 88181
hundred 88229
miles 88245
Avoiding 88279
Kingston 88322
which 88331
was 88368

by 88413
a 88468
superior 88482
force 88498
of 88505
Confederates 88511
he 88516
marched 88573
rapidly 88582
on 88594
Knoxville 88680
destroying 88758
all 88760
the 88788
more 88806

Demonstrating 88896
boldly 88911
in 88924
front 88928
of 88959
Knoxville 89050
and 89112
finding 89127

he 89603
passed 89616
around 89650

and 89946
advanced 89966
upon 89973

He 94028
now 94054
turned 94076
homeward 94143
toward 94152
the 94160

a 108321

a 111152
small 111205
body 111235

aside 111705
It 111720
is 111727

to 111738

slave-trader 112847
a 112894
calling 112907

implied 112982
social 113046
ostracism 113103
in 113114
the 113124
South 113127

put 113270

Forrest 113686
was 113730
a 113750
really 113784
daring 113805
soldier 113822
and 113828
fought 113888
his 113965
way 113983
to 113994
recognition 114024

this 138697

be 138750
natural 138758

conclude 138782
that 138809
when 138832

approached 138871
Louisville 138884
he 138897
began 138935

doubt 138973
whether 138989
the 139025
city 139040
were 139062
so 139083
defenceless 139089
as 139092
he 139112
had 139134
assumed 139168
and 139190
knowing 139204
that 139233
twenty-four 139270
hours' 139308
delay 139334
would 139337
bring 139343
Hobson's 139479
forces 139484
upon 139488
his 139549
back 139570
he 139576
then 139601
looked 139642
about 139690
for 139776
some 139831
line 139834
of 139849
action 139855
that 139873
would 139876
save 139890
his 139892
prestige 139916
and 139930
be 139943
more 139956
brilliant 139964
than 139975
a 139983
race 140015
back 140056
again 140070
to 140076
Tennessee 140091
It 140115
is 140130
quite 140143
probable 140160
that 140167
the 140198
feasibility 140232
of 140250
crossing 140323
the 140344
Ohio 140444
and 140453
making 140558
a 140645
rapid 140668
ride 140689

the 140771
country 140788

its 140838
northern 140841
bank 140892
had 140914
been 140920
discussed 140961
by 140978
him 140991
and 140999
conscious 141032
as 141072
he 141131
was 141139
that 141199
he 141207
had 141275
thus 141292
far 141306
accomplished 141337
nothing 141391
he 141395
might 141406
be 141439
glad 141445
of 141454
an 141489
excuse 141499
for 141534
trying 141581
it 141635
This 141663
interpretation 141721
of 141748
his 141757
acts 141896
would 141908
be 141927
more 141947
honorable 142016
to 142069
him 142107
as 142116
an 142143

Burnside 2312

the 5872

the 12002
Ninth 12013
Corps 12518
from 12848

till 16519
long 16683
after 16852
the 18499

was 18910
over 19586
None 20523
of 22627
the 22733
National 23378
army's 25015
communications 25374
were 26204

a 27701

ration 32867
by 33040
reason 33069
of 34630
the 34923
pretentious 35029
expedition 35051
It 35067
ended 35395
in 35522
a 35759
scene 35828
that 36207
was 36326
ridiculous 36537
in 37416
the 37524
extreme 38388
Morgan 38541
had 38730
pressed 38813
into 38859
his 39635
service 42059
as 42515
guides 42790
on 44689
the 45000
last 45122
day 45778
of 46338
his 47019
flight 47056
two 48009
men 48312
who 49105
were 51325
not 51390
even 52780
officers 53160
of 54760
the 55553
local 55746
militia 56120
but 57175
who 58917
were 60427
acting 61194
as 61941
volunteer 62940
homeguards 63737
to 63841
protect 65113
their 66158
neighborhood 66632
When 66714
he 68429
finally 69607
despaired 69621
of 69836
escape 70452
he 70470
begged 70988
his 71001
captive 71219
guides 72039
to 72555
change 74359
their 75391
role 75439
into 75631
commanders 75827
of 76373
an 76643
imaginary 78110
army 78142
and 78345
to 79492
accept 79872
his 79972
surrender 83307
upon 83539
merciful 84213
and 84258
favorable 84543
terms 85712
to 87782
the 88383
vanquished 88389
He 88577
afterward 88585
claimed 89166
the 89636
right 89770
to 93437
immediate 94047
liberation 95074
on 95111
parole 95141
under 95174
the 95301
conditions 95505
of 95546
this 96799
burlesque 98447
capitulation 98459
Shackelford 98535
and 99000
his 100924
rough 101496
riders 102164
would 102610
accept 102783
no 102885
surrender 103363
but 103573
an 104512
unconditional 105394
one 106180
as 106241
prisoners 107194
of 107507
war 107655
and 108051
were 108234
sustained 108638

was 131724
some 131805
six 131903
hundred 132025
miles 133025
This 133228

the 133720

and 127233
whilst 124072
we 128438
in 65439
Ohio 80641
were 130490
absorbed 106809
in 106898
the 149711
excitement 73990
of 105850
it 100973
events 144315
were 64401
moving 158159
elsewhere 27444
Lee 118623

from 86799
Virginia 93803
through 56832
Maryland 130308

Pennsylvania 15526

had 46076
been 66660
defeated 77984
at 131121
Gettysburg 144492
by 181333
the 89876
National 60450
army 75715
under 149305
Meade 61271
Grant 127119
had 159314
brought 21640
the 79982
siege 103984
of 46112
Vicksburg 115877
to 135982
a 173082
glorious 57740
conclusion 117020
and 29199
had 74494
received 34374
the 63124
surrender 82797
of 83683
Pemberton 46878
with 146009
his 163949
army 151155
of 127784
Confederates 128427
These 30386
victories 71514
coming 13879
together 91977
as 5606
they 7349
did 7499
and 10136
on 14526
the 58502
4th 82639
of 92968
July 130485
made 141836
the 163560
national 185151
anniversary 6369
seem 7317
more 7396
than 7431
ever 7907
a 67611
day 160537
of 49391
rejoicing 54531
and 159332
of 7470
hope 13980
to 116771
the 135132
whole 140929
people 763
We 3338
did 146390
not 76253
get 134339
the 1664
news 63849
of 66695
Grant's 70851
victory 81035
quite 85951
so 139925
soon 34830
as 162666
that 6475
of 56627
Meade's 83818
but 101726
it 104651
came 155616
to 16459
us 23281
at 29227
Cincinnati 41202
in 73565
a 75435
way 86002
to 104521
excite 126946
peculiar 7911
enthusiasm 22834
An 23168
excellent 30234
operatic 68988
company 71021
was 80539
giving 84157
a 84208
series 86098
of 93903

in 117043
the 131760

7th 180216
of 139872
July 145613
General 129759
Burnside 20868
and 42661
his 98802
wife 147940
had 168230
one 14199
of 25251
the 27386
proscenium 42025
boxes 56064
and 88069
my 98935
wife 104626
and 112927
I 117960
were 122222
their 125806
guests 130187
The 149814
second 152675
act 156699
had 157260
just 163204
closed 170957
with 182691
the 183834
famous 185384
trumpet 4755
song 75035
in 107401
which 91983
Susini 183616
the 77956
great 125542
basso 149123
of 91169
the 25807
day 5209
had 118572
created 27711
a 34346
furore 127872
A 26381
messenger 44557
entered 64563
the 82793
box 85370
where 111692
the 128293
general 157123
was 155036
surrounded 128793
by 13254
a 108763
brilliant 51412
company 51649
and 51903
gave 52889
him 53263
a 77736
dispatch 61185
which 81551
announced 141855
the 86860
surrender 5476
of 147178
Vicksburg 122821
and 99046
Pemberton's 102802
army 20787
Burnside 142075
overjoyed 59753
announced 57365
the 68052
great 119262
news 155858
to 166730
us 81561
who 4705
were 77223
near 119367
him 140881
and 150553
then 6683
stepped 28011
to 102147
the 53037
front 54075
of 59240
the 87449
box 99429
to 89087
make 130858
the 17504
whole 45487
audience 185229
sharers 4803
in 41676
the 87639
pleasure 129671
As 20060
soon 43814
as 8628
he 181910
was 4199
seen 8559
with 22124
the 28832
paper 28959
in 34183
his 37109
hand 38186
the 57698
house 57927
was 60572
hushed 68435
and 70646
his 71614
voice 83137
rang 104567
through 106304
it 111158
as 111830
he 112521
proclaimed 116827
the 118018
great 123501
victory 128594
and 129276
declared 133429
it 175318
a 182456
long 565
stride 106901
toward 89202
the 154454
restoration 99219
of 99278
the 87502
Union 99301
The 11926
people 23586
went 24737
almost 44841
wild 168922
with 138567
excitement 21229
the 2297
men 52232
shouted 130981
hurrahs 143911
the 3553
ladies 45989
waved 47876
their 53384
handkerchiefs 58994
and 68072
clapped 102045
their 134713
hands 129888
all 152089
rising 36763
to 81625
their 94683
feet 8495
The 13334
cheering 645
was 2052
long 2406
as 2536
well 4357
as 4864
loud 6076
and 6516
before 8759
it 8965
subsided 9983
the 10091
excitement 10844
reached 10967
behind 12337
the 12809
stage 12969
The 13136
curtain 14038
rose 14411
again 14444
and 14968
Susini 15577
came 19662
forward 22090
with 22644
a 22797
national 23048
flag 23099
in 23202
each 23303
hand 23663
waving 24019
them 24482
enthusiastically 24536
whilst 24576
his 24834
magnificent 24987
voice 25412
resounded 25466
in 25559
a 25577
repetition 26003
of 26201
the 26321
song 26525
he 26851
had 27129
just 28765
sung 29272
and 29453
which 29480
seemed 29487
as 30071
appropriate 30361
as 30428
if 32146
it 32184
were 32194
inspired 32254
for 32449
the 32455
occasion 32484
Suoni 32719

The 42291
rejoicing 44922
and 45462
the 45615
cheers 45717
were 45725
repeated 45799
to 45849
the 46382
echo 46455
and 46548
when 46684
at 46695
last 47245
they 47451
subsided 47750
the 47801
rest 48456
of 48522
the 48588
opera 48769
was 48788
only 48822
half 48831
listened 48943
to 49161
suppressed 49172
excitement 49342
filling 49552
every 50538
heart 51197
and 53447
the 54614
thought 54866
of 57913
the 59352
great 59844
results 60324
to 63161
flow 63311
from 64666
the 65571
victories 66057
absorbing 66172
every 66305
mind 67259
Burnside 67300
reckoned 68230
with 71298
entire 71634
certainty 71993
on 72075
the 73937
immediate 74304
return 74367
of 74789
the 77390
Ninth 77444

announced 100698
Grant's 103243

Burnside 106100

I 116451

I 131090
am 131609

replied 5536
You 5569
do 5637
not 7269
appear 7284
to 8340
observe 8543
the 8580
fact 8895
that 9518
this 9599

driven 13475
the 13487

my 18980

advised 19563
you 19734
I 20186
beg 20508
in 21088
behalf 21201
of 21991
this 22869
army 22962
that 23534
the 23783
War 24042
Department 24107
may 25839
not 25864
overlook 26272
so 26842
great 27032
an 27341
event 28081
because 28116
it 28732
is 28885
not 29201
written 29660
in 30326
letters 31118
of 31256

He 32800
however 32831
did 33273
not 33466
intimate 33656
any 33989
purpose 34340
of 35111
advancing 35248
No 35336
doubt 35439
the 35621
manoeuvering 36738
of 37225
Bragg 37257
out 37459

his 38317
fortified 38513
positions 38682
at 38784
Shelbyville 39112
and 39706
Tullahoma 39941
had 40195
been 40468
well 40552
done 40611
but 40848
its 41672
chief 41683
value 42029
was 42123
that 42167
it 42310
forced 42480
Bragg 42546

promptly 49202
followed 49285
up 49750

another 51762

of 61239
an 61967
early 62054

he 65050
could 65072
rebuild 65832

River 66340
bridge 67016

resume 67889

would 68886
probably 72101
have 72165
relieved 72455
the 72538

so 72693
noticeable 72763

necessity 81344

private 104258

confidential 105714
letters 106316
in 107142

Halleck 107618
explains 107687
the 109405
situation 109457

strongly 110625
asserts 111651
his 111760
friendship 111919
for 112469
Rosecrans 112730

the 113443

good 122193
intentions 122949

Halleck 123717

the 125291
wisdom 125574
of 125958
it 126648
is 127515
very 127630
questionable 127808
It 128157
gave 128280
Rosecrans 128729
ground 129009
to 129115
assume 129551
that 130758
the 130917
official 131353
dispatches 133037
were 133234
only 133285
the 135633

It 7145
has 9221

argued 10551
that 10757
Rosecrans's 11812
weakness 11932
of 13267
character 14143
consisted 14153
in 14165
a 14291
disposition 14543

quarrel 23064
with 23759
those 23784
in 23843
power 23974

him 24145

that 24332
a 24509
spirit 24780
of 24998
contradiction 25095
thwarted 25127
the 25169
good 25236
military 25270
conduct 25286
which 25317
his 25822
natural 25886
energy 25949
might 26023
have 26368
produced 27998
I 28138
cannot 28567
help 28877
reading 30542
his 30871
controversial 30908

my 42685
personal 43096

of 43317
the 43483
man 43832
and 44169
my 46302
conviction 46406
is 46689
that 47189
his 47254
quarrelsome 48148
mode 48178
of 48294
dealing 48978
with 50932
the 51051
War 51088

was 53620
the 54054
result 54222
of 54769
a 55984
real 59214
weakness 61344
of 61621
will 61780
and 62055
purpose 62728
which 63285
did 65223
not 70952
take 70968
naturally 71362

great 73602

infirmity 88958

really 96955
enterprising 97659
commander 97756
in 97915

early 129512

the 46315

not 159417
known 161395
to 173052
Halleck 174390
but 174491
it 38988
is 120984
hard 154560
to 28191
believe 129726
that 129757
the 153665
latter 46426

ignorant 53489
of 55923

Morgan 150052

Ohio 35690

The 37362
13th 37691

thirteen 66027

of 147642
Cincinnati 2553
Burnside 140469
was 144799
organizing 146342
all 145410
the 145462
militia 162519
of 56031
southern 90051
Ohio 151470

Twenty-third 2295

One 15613

these 17831
was 17870
on 18297
a 18323
fleet 20196
of 20967

which 21867
reached 22092
Cincinnati 22980
that 23292

the 23967
other 26632

in 29376
close 29392

the 29945

Where 30123
should 30363
Burnside 30942
have 31071
been 31363
if 31441
not 32951
at 33160
Cincinnati 34290
If 42188
the 44807

Halleck 53449

said 53812
all 53875
petty 56146
raids 56527
should 65837
be 65864
this 65901
which 65972
was 66054
not 66072
a 66232
petty 66415
raid 66647
would 66796
pretty 67181
certainly 68215
have 68225
had 68346
results 68366
which 68396
would 68470
have 68492
produced 68667
more 68719
discomfort 69119
at 69164
Washington 69411
than 69535
the 69683
idea 70559
that 70840
Burnside 73380
was 74190
tied 74306
fast 75525
to 76626
Cincinnati 80135
Burnside 83470
was 84730
exactly 85064
where 88621
he 92755
ought 92908
to 93110
be 93250
and 97564
doing 102292
admirable 113881
work 113916
which 114061
resulted 114075
in 114301
the 125004
capture 130979
of 131200
the 131362
division 131445

from 133257
the 133278
general 133552
in 133728
command 133822
downward 134211
That 134742
the 136334
General-in-Chief 136672
was 136755
entirely 137341
ignorant 137453
of 138257
what 138625
was 138682
going 138959
on 139067
when 139420
every 139457
intelligent 139612
citizen 139718
of 141351
the 147858
country 148296
was 150049
excited 158331
over 164244
it 164403
and 167827
every 168199
newspaper 173047
was 173842
full 174002
of 174053
it 174327
reflects 174714
far 176072
more 176184
severely 176249
upon 176441
him 176760
than 177655
upon 178849
Burnside 179051
But 179803
this 179966
was 180522
by 180949
no 181065
means 181095
the 181494
whole 2408
He 131092
forgot 1455
that 65761

he 65771
stopped 987
Burnside's 29062
movement 3267
on 176002

Cumberland 138803
Gap 141775
abandoned 143333

the 146572

detachments 147022
coming 147033
through 147036
it 147044
from 147183
Kentucky 147540
left 147582
to 148082
the 149770
tender 152151
mercies 152163
of 152716
Jones 155562
and 157030
his 157115
Confederates 157255
who 157342
could 157423
capture 160683
them 161031
at 161058
their 161228
leisure 161438
and 161608
without 162147
a 162202
blow 162270
It 162888
was 162902
equally 162920
incredible 166868
that 167132
the 167154
government 169645
could 170958
wish 175170
to 175340
stop 183131
the 183165
organization 185179
of 185205
the 185215
loyalists 185222
just 185249

were 126562
being 146619
distributed 44602
to 59202
them 153673

to 158821
abandon 159691
them 160775
to 160000
the 162157
enemy 5337
when 48601
their 57432
recent 66366
open 122251
demonstrations 155267
in 170768
favor 170838
of 30496
the 53693
Union 53914
would 55614
make 30483
their 62539
condition 31495
infinitely 31567
worse 62478
than 174360
if 177050
our 172052
troops 172381
had 80587
never 41665
come 8606
to 43513
them 130487
The 50139
rational 174456
interpretation 179977
and 10237
the 13197
one 41491
Burnside 42031
gave 42458
it 46819
was 50148
that 69778
the 71624
alternative 76854
which 89728
had 117317
been 123245
stated 125762
in 136394
the 157893
earlier 162249
dispatch 162255
of 174383
the 183753
11th 184883
had 185028
been 38774
settled 14837
in 6513
favor 6703
of 6872
a 21342
general 26030
movement 29024
southward 30395
instead 33470
of 44637
eastward 47837
and 48226
that 49810
this 69874
made 133338
it 136358
all 141269
the 142995
more 161824
imperative 163631
that 172077
he 172418
should 176010
disembarrass 562
himself 12491
of 12705
General 12858
Jones 15500
and 21542
establish 28814
a 36437
line 67126
on 113161
the 116856
upper 151668
Holston 171769
which 176508
a 6158
small 10772

could 150630
hold 5069
whilst 9042
he 38818
with 58201
the 111822
rest 115200
of 120750
the 161242
two 170686
corps 179495
should 41582
move 46786
southward 131243
as 169254
soon 17559
as 25732
the 31322
Ninth 303
Corps 4689
could 4714
make 6968
the 7454
march 9472
from 10230
Kentucky 11586
This 12004
was 12748
exactly 13012
what 15841
General 17592
Schofield 17754
did 17837
in 21410
the 21624
next 25051
spring 25598
when 26605
he 26661
was 27764
ordered 28129
to 29602
join 32024
Sherman 32499
with 33945
the 35425
Army 36989

I 44264
do 45925
not 51907
hesitate 54991
to 56990
say 58090
that 58447
it 59408
was 59577
the 62004
only 66903
thing 67131
which 67540
an 67723
intelligent 68572
military 69953
man 70993
on 73493
the 73724
ground 74100
and 74804
knowing 75191
the 75396
topography 75615
would 78368
think 79071
of 82009
doing 83399
To 83531
make 84658
a 85156
panicky 85552
abandonment 90467
of 91228
the 91242
country 92071
and 93361
of 94430
the 96759

and 97499
detachments 98844
en 99661
route 104261
to 105290
it 105685
would 107683
have 107997
been 109236
hardly 111093
less 112294
disgraceful 114575
than 117499
a 118071
surrender 118119
of 119669
the 120255
whole 120354
To 120587
Burnside's 121118
honor 121260
and 125535
credit 125665
it 126065
should 127242
be 128080
recorded 130647
that 133763
he 134872
did 139197
not 139274
dream 139511
of 140288
doing 145249
it 146996
He 147145
strained 149225
every 149235
nerve 150867
to 153848
hasten 154641
the 156696
movement 158297
of 158354
his 158885
troops 159950
so 162772
as 162833
to 162978
get 163481
through 163664
with 163674
his 166541
little 169969
campaign 170362
against 170627

by 174587
the 175174
time 176662
the 178524
Ninth 179118
Corps 179340
could 179490
come 180809
from 112036
Kentucky 154676
and 157481
if 58574
he 62021
could 64490
accomplish 58264
it 64465
within 659
that 9993
limit 53788
he 59199
would 120666
have 150862
the 180363
right 5884
to 115622
challenge 52572
the 4863
judgment 4869
of 5095
every 6424
competent 7819
critic 9298
whether 10919
he 12988
had 13913
not 14628
done 19971
that 24010
which 24086
became 31376
a 31980
good 40565
soldier 43209
and 46799
a 46827
good 48281
general 50013
On 50747
the 53446
17th 54845
of 56789
September 61433
the 62113
concentration 62545
of 71705
Burnside's 73003
infantry 75194
toward 76887
Greeneville 77716
had 78621
so 80193
far 81948
progressed 86708
that 86718
he 91639
was 92527
preparing 92565
to 92596
go 92728
personally 92985
to 94561
the 94801
front 96849
and 98152
lead 98718
them 102447
against 106484
the 107706
enemy 112523
It 116610
is 123416
noticeable 124440
in 126800
the 129219
whole 129290
campaign 130380
that 130703
he 144443
took 144479
this 144597
personal 146101
leadership 148857
and 150538
activity 155925
on 164193
himself 166906
In 169941
Hartsuff's 172926
condition 175443
of 289
health 3462
it 3552
would 3622
have 3889
been 3948
within 4151
the 4209
ordinary 4266
methods 4435
of 4573
action 4637
that 4914
the 4917
next 4925
in 4997
rank 5158
should 5662
assume 5839
command 5953
of 5972
the 6162
Twenty-third 6192
Corps 6269
and 6273
that 6362
the 6393
department 6497
commander 6796
should 7096
remain 7251
at 7471
his 7637
headquarters 7668
at 7682
Knoxville 7692
But 7777
Hartsuff 7806
was 7825
able 7843
to 7873
attend 7892
to 7918
office 7945
business 7994
and 8108
so 8211
Burnside 8257
practically 8268
exchanged 8289
places 8298
with 8442
him 8454
leaving 8569
his 8837
subordinate 8841
with 9132
discretion 9694

direct 10180

at 12065
Cumberland 12075

when 12147

received 12403

Frazer 12609
he 12624
was 12629
doing 12765
it 12788
now 12808

was 13522
to 13617
do 13633

again 14020
still 14035

He 20064
explained 20531
the 20730
failure 20749
of 20867
the 21067

the 21192

promised 24069
stout 24142
resistance 24176
finding 24228
satisfaction 24354
in 24435
the 24610
thought 24632
that 24827

therefore 71211
regard 71353
the 71374
enemy 71458
concentrating 71469
in 71484

as 71729
only 71948
the 71977
same 72022
which 72050
Rosecrans 72200
had 72237
been 72331
peremptorily 72347
ordered 72420
to 72450
attack 72491
and 72560
which 72596
he 72628
had 72651
been 72739
supposed 72843
to 72870
be 72939
strong 72973
enough 73078
to 73264
cope 73319

No 73492

was 73885
stated 73973
at 74059
which 74504
the 74803

Georgia 74874
would 74898
probably 74921
occur 75094

Chattanooga 78409

join 78954
in 79020
the 79159
Georgia 79208
campaign 79447
was 79459
plainly 79655
Burnside's 79769
duty 79939
If 80004
it 80048
would 80064
be 80265
too 80427
rash 80586
for 80596
Rosecrans 80607
to 80844
give 81905
battle 82027
without 82386
reinforcements 82506
that 82652
officer 82762
was 82768
competent 83075
to 83411
manoeuvre 83437
his 83654
army 84017
in 84042
retreat 84438
and 84455
take 84474
a 84743
defensible 85238
position 85551
till 85788
his 85799
reinforcements 85814
could 86531
come 87818
That 87873
course 87915
would 87982
be 88171
certainly 88242
much 88425
wiser 88490
than 88540
to 88549
abandon 88568
East 88770

the 89031

the 89918

of 90442
such 90502
an 90570

even 94392
such 94421
instantaneous 94828

eighty 111807

the 114285
way 114771
The 114857
troops 114972
must 115092
march 115114
and 115139
could 115191
not 115308
by 115434
any 115448
physical 115459
possibility 115468
make 115771
a 115781
quarter 116044

the 116599
distance 116724
before 116765
Rosecrans's 116785
fate 117068
at 117136
Chickamauga 117152
should 117162
be 117258
decided 117330
The 117450
authorities 117638
at 118461
Washington 119484
must 119610
bear 119827
the 119887
responsibility 119982
for 120139
complete 120251
ignorance 120254
of 120269
these 120528
conditions 120731
or 120743
what 120758
would 120900
be 121094
equally 121115
bad 121122
a 121152
forgetfulness 121961
of 122187
them 122211
in 122626
a 122668
moment 122696
of 122726
panic 123236
But 123261
Burnside 123633
did 123951
not 123985
know 124021
and 124026
could 124052
not 124504
guess 125906
that 126046
a 126197
battle 126307
was 127318
to 127443
be 127466
fought 127494
so 127556
soon 127581
All 127772
he 127806
could 127997
do 128326
was 128417
to 128654
prepare 129790
to 130178
carry 130205
out 130613
the 131351
wishes 131415
of 131568
the 131686
War 131758
Department 131813
as 131998
speedily 132016
as 132176
could 132312
be 132486
without 132490
the 132641
total 132727
ruin 132741
of 132773
East 132833
Tennessee 132992
and 133231
all 133269
he 133280
had 133379
accomplished 133558
Such 133719
ruin 134116
might 134121
come 134376
by 134663
the 134668
fate 134712
of 134725
war 134735
if 134802
he 134980
were 135022
driven 135040
out 135056
by 135093
superior 135105
force 135164
but 135303
he 135450
would 135459
have 135484
been 135673
rightly 135693
condemned 135777
if 136168
it 136282
had 136302
come 136435
by 136771
his 137070
precipitate 137098
abandonment 137216
of 137250
the 137275
country 137306
He 137558
did 137599
more 137653
to 137743
carry 138960
out 139181
Halleck's 139246
wish 139441
than 139640
was 139669
quite 139886
prudent 140753
He 140797
stopped 140860
the 140872
troops 140898
which 140911
had 140966
not 140974
yet 140976
reached 140988
Greeneville 141024
and 141273
ordered 141317
a 141797
countermarch 141810
He 141852
hastened 141867
up 141871
the 141877
country 141887
to 141906
make 141997
the 142000
attack 142052
upon 142246
the 142272
Confederates 142305
with 142402
the 142407
force 142913
he 143117
already 143450
had 143498
in 143634
their 143653
presence 143661
and 143756
then 143806
to 143823
bring 143937
the 144137
infantry 144212
back 144307
at 144513
once 144706
hoping 144869
the 145181
cavalry 145223
could 145278
hold 145342
in 145623
check 145716
a 145758
defeated 146008
enemy 146146
The 146215
necessity 146346
of 146358
delivering 146546
a 146625
blow 146860
at 147402
General 148025
Jones 148090
was 148283
afterwards 148357
criticised 148565
by 148913
Halleck 149140
but 149222
it 149234
was 149318
in 149339
accordance 149427
with 149469
the 149478
sound 149503
rules 149849
of 149862
conducting 149871
war 150034
To 150258
have 150492
called 150731
back 150807
his 150854
troops 151503
without 151532
a 151543
fight 151548
would 151555
have 151576
been 151728
to 151996
give 152016
the 152044
enemy 152048
double 152053
courage 152065
by 152135
his 152145
retreat 152210
and 152248
his 152961

been 153190
chased 153266
by 153302
the 153312
exulting 153450
foe 153459
They 153490
would 153621
either 153721
have 153837
been 154069
forced 154186
to 154924
halt 155736
and 155964
fight 156481
their 156743
pursuers 156792

every 156885
disadvantage 156937

loss 156970
of 156997
prestige 157031
and 158082
of 158381
the 158472
initiative 158533
or 159051
have 159084
made 159134
a 159178
precipitate 159247
flight 159254
which 159855
would 160464
have 160901
gone 161231
far 161317
to 162003
ruin 162011

this 163647
involved 163666
an 163902
advance 164135
from 164321
Greeneville 164333

the 166179
enemy 166204
near 166212
there 166254
and 166327
this 166450
was 166689
the 166787
only 166807
successful 166843
mode 166923

opened 25092
just 25193

the 28650

showed 28864
how 28999

how 29348

Rosecrans 35814

way 36329
Burnside 36407
pointed 36604
out 36895
that 37226
this 37567

an 49656
amazing 50162
proof 50816
that 51182
he 51416
had 51536
never 51663
comprehended 51686
the 51717
campaign 51820
He 52203
reiterated 52243
that 52278
Burnside's 52372

leaving 53161
Kentucky 53578

If 59633
this 59657
meant 61058
anything 61074
it 61159
meant 61181
that 61253
Burnside 61879
was 61945
to 62056
keep 62215
within 62408
a 62432
day's 62454
march 62789
of 62814
Rosecrans 63218
for 63358
two 63949
days 64131
was 64203
more 64591
than 64847
enough 65034
to 65044
fight 65081
out 65087
a 65114
battle 65460
like 65604
Chickamauga 65700
Yet 65937
he 65991
and 66341
everybody 66379
else 66387
knew 66526
that 66595
Burnside's 66784
supply 66802

from 67231
Kentucky 67321
was 67491
through 68196
Cumberland 68754
Gap 68927
and 69570
he 70361
had 70590
warmly 71035
applauded 71397
when 71573
Burnside 71793
turned 72049
that 72142
position 72254
and 72322
by 72467
investing 72516
it 73486
in 73496
front 73541
and 73593
rear 73599
had 73689
forced 73868
Frazer 73892

surrender 74058
He 74141
had 74202
explicitly 74817
directed 74947
Burnside 75300
to 75625
occupy 75673

hold 76054

one 79345

This 19213

essentially 140644
what 142704

afterward 173854
did 181239
putting 181977

This 65677
had 67635
a 70611
strong 71216

to 74004
the 74180
strategy 74208
of 74267

Burnside 100091
added 101843
to 102603

the 108898

of 118042
a 119019
march 122390
to 128122
the 129234
sea 130436
proposing 130674
that 131908
if 132329
Bragg 134536
pursued 135119
him 135871
he 136259
should 136609

Atlanta 146938
destroying 147849
it 149969
as 150170
thoroughly 155577
as 155988
possible 156039
and 158775
then 159968
make 161030

The 177156
last 177467
of 178788
these 178862
plans 178994
was 180615
that 181067
which 130822
Burnside 140934
preferred 147445

that 153256
moment 209
for 244
Rosecrans 686
was 3638
so 5126
far 6191
demoralized 6674
by 7103
the 7307
effects 7681
of 7795
his 8379
late 8661

that 8828

Halleck 17192

this 18157
only 19262
meant 21366
that 21407

wanted 22357
his 23582

Chattanooga 24647
reinforced 25738

any 26215

though 27348
he 27958
could 28907
not 30506
supply 30624
them 30729
and 30747
the 31530
fortifications 31672
were 31762
already 31829
so 31853
strong 32396
that 32994
General 33632

on 40306
Burnside's 41260
character 41572

fertile 45843
in 47317

disposed 51052
to 51503
adopt 51521
the 51637
boldest 52682

Halleck 53334

MY 77302
DEAR 121226
GENERAL 149223
--Your 32115
note 75432
of 16038
the 44553
4th 178054
instant 6212
came 25893
during 14934
a 27688
brief 43019
absence 53853
from 56431
home 60953
I 75973
appreciate 76484
your 88786
kindness 94154
and 94206
your 113296
friendly 119143
suggestions 127266
After 127406
sleeping 140197
on 147988
it 148682
I 152688
am 158128
not 175337
inclined 177040
to 178367
depart 184115
from 27929
my 27959
custom 49017
in 59584
dealing 93988
with 94015
attacks 97117
upon 123134
me 125129
Besides 159487
to 170233
give 176997
a 22495
correct 45980
relation 80706
of 89531
the 133753
Reno 134580
altercation 154483
would 178303
be 7996
to 129801
disparage 151459

died 507

battle 1095
a 1135
few 1200

who 2359
cannot 2366
now 2444
give 2486
his 2491
side 2656
of 2797
the 2859
controversy 2877
One 2968
of 3049
the 3087
brigades 3383
of 3965
the 4036
division 4047
was 4211

in 11343
its 11390
general 11554
facts 11592
was 11775

you 12450
recall 12478

But 12540
the 12575
occasion 12656
of 12816
it 12892
was 12901
this 12937
The 13076
regiment 13123
halted 13188
to 13411
bivouac 13860
in 13865
a 13889
stubble-field 13915
The 14498
men 14505
got 14515
bundles 14534
of 14593
straw 14632
or 14653
possibly 14833

The 18282

accosted 19139
the 19335
men 19522
and 19635
as 19908
I 20102
returned 20282
I 20343
heard 20400
his 20587

and 20645
retorted 20788
in 20913
behalf 21251
of 21279
my 21288
men 21381
not 21512

for 22347

generally 41461
The 41553
twenty 41569

have 41802
elapsed 41860
make 41884
my 41909

Kanawha 45668
Division 45770
compared 45792
favorably 45867
in 45917
discipline 46049
and 46209
general 46234
good 46286
conduct 46494
with 47069
the 47314
best 47341
troops 47480
of 47514
the 47576
army 47716
In 48116
my 48265
own 48323
brigade 48425
there 48496
was 48701
no 48721
straggling 48954
or 49588
if 49646
any 49758
so 50063
little 50131
that 50666
it 50687
did 50727
not 50922
come 50962
to 51057
my 51239
notice 51259
I 51815
am 51897
quite 51936
sure 51963
there 52021
was 52064
no 52156
pillaging 52192
in 52261
my 52444
brigade 52582
My 52633
men 52785
probably 52802
took 52816
fence 52841
rails 52932
for 52956
their 52979
bivouac 53228
fires 53353
and 53441
straw 53625
and 53657
hay 54077
for 54158
their 54166
beds 54296
but 54305
to 54360
the 54508
best 54555
of 54670
my 54739
belief 54768
there 54815
was 54823
nothing 54975
done 55433
that 55649
could 55757
be 56062
called 56076
pillaging 56142
I 56289
heard 58262
at 58290
the 58413
time 58418
something 58966
with 58997
reference 59134
to 59245
a 59909
controversy 60359
between 60875
Generals 61099
Reno 61478
and 61522
Hayes 61760
but 61898
if 61954
ever 62141
I 62209
knew 62253
what 62264
it 62268
was 62383
about 62386
I 62489
have 62498
forgotten 62531
it 62549
In 62684
this 62690
matter 62720
it 62853
seems 62907
as 62967
if 63039
the 63284
statement 63288
of 63535
General 63640
Hayes 64180
should 64193
be 64248
conclusive 64305
I 64367
am 64486
very 64580
glad 64958
that 65039
you 65215
have 65222
interested 65393
yourself 65641
in 65718
refuting 66125
the 66179
numberless 66384
charges 66404
which 66576
the 66768
writers 66890
of 66976
personal 67209
histories 67316
have 67354
found 67533
it 67648
convenient 68100
to 68118
lay 68129
against 68170
the 68179
Kanawha 68193
Division 68284
and 68336
which 68390
in 68407
almost 68461
every 68477
instance 68668
are 68675
base 68682
slanders 68700
The 68872
personnel 69123
of 69248
the 69672
division 69689
should 69736
in 69801
itself 69822
be 69883
a 69899
sufficient 70028
refutation 70039
The 70080
regiments 70120
were 70156
mainly 70281
of 70342
men 70351
from 70429
country 70447
districts 70483
who 70726
enlisted 70754
from 70787
motives 70909
of 71005
patriotism 71043
and 71283
as 71301
a 71410
rule 71523
were 71578
never 71828
disgraced 71873
by 71930
conduct 72007
which 72118
many 72139
of 72283
the 72292
regiments 72547
enlisted 72608
in 72800
the 72935
large 73089
cities 73148
of 73293
the 73409
East 73429
were 73670
notorious 73676
for 73686
throughout 73932
the 73965
army 73992
The 74030
Kanawha 74312
Division 74471
did 74730
not 74779
belong 75370
to 75497
the 75884
Army 76006
of 76071
the 76093
Potomac 76104
and 76159
it 76268
was 76460
therefore 76490
an 76503
easy 76564
matter 76710
to 76838
shift 76845
responsibility 76948
from 76993
its 77066
own 77164
organization 77312
by 77519
throwing 77598
it 77668
on 77712
the 77757
shoulders 77814
of 77831
the 77940
troops 77946
serving 78063
with 78122
it 78182
The 78241
subsequent 78308
reputation 78340
of 78365
this 78441
division 78496
is 78500
in 78554
itself 78638
a 78745
sufficient 78816
answer 78857
and 78879
I 78969
challenge 78982
history 79013
to 79076
show 79113
an 79213
organization 79332
which 79374
was 79419
more 79483
distinguished 79576
for 79674
all 79836
soldierly 79866
qualities 80058
than 80215
the 80231
one 80260
you 80322
had 80328
the 80495
honor 80568
to 80575
command 80669
during 81052
the 81085

gave 81850
